1982,"[The load order is not well-defined, so relying on it may lead to issues. It's difficult to determine if the map plugin will break due to binary compatibility differences between versions. In the past, I've worked around such problems by including the library's code as a git submodule from a fork and then updating it to a specific version. While this approach can be messy and requires tracking changes, it's often the most reasonable way to deal with jar hell.]",1

Alternatively, we could separate the listener into another bean, but that also seems unnecessarily complicated. I have a warmup service that I want to test once without executing it for every test. Any suggestions?]",0

1986,"[If achieving 100% coverage is not feasible in the normal workflow, we can consider using PowerMock. If that doesn't help either, we can resort to using reflection, although it's generally not recommended. However, since this is limited to the test area of the code and we derive significant value from achieving 100% coverage, we can tolerate some compromise in code clarity. It would be helpful to add comments explaining the design decisions. You can find examples of complex stream mocking and the use of reflection in our tests.]",0

The property override configurer is used to work around the problem with the abstract application context. Since the application context instantiates the ordered bean factory post processor simultaneously, subsequent loaded property override configurers don't have any influence on later loaded ones.]",0
