Currently, the first byte of each bucket tells whether that bucket is used or not. Instead, if we reserved numBucket bytes at the start of the buffer and used those for marking, it might be faster to zero those out when most of the buckets were marked as used. Additionally, I don't recall if we tried, or if there was any other consideration, to use different layouts to mark used or unused buckets.

I suppose at this point, the benchmark needs to be redesigned to account for it...or maybe not :P The whole point of this benchmark was to measure/observe the ""user experience"" and that's what a user would experience indeed; if that's obtained by luck (of timing) that's an unfortunate outcome.",0

1984,"@user, but if you disable the entire bean, you won't be able to inject it into tests, so the only solution becomes the rather unattractive alternative:```java @user public void start(ApplicationReadyEvent event) {   if (event.getApplicationContext().getEnvironment().acceptsProfiles(Profiles.of(""test"")))    return;   do Something(); }```Alternatively, we could consider separating the listener to another bean, which is not ideal. I have a warmup service, and if I don't disable it, it will execute for every test, but I still want to test it once so.",0

You can find examples of complicated streams mocking and unsightliness reflection in our test.",0

Well, I can't speak for TextSecure, but IMHO the Google ""Noto Color Emoji"" Emoji set looks like shi*. Let's face it, most people (or at least a lot), do not like the Google Emoji Set. If you don't believe me, then maybe you should read the comments in the following two issues on the AOSP issue tracker:  http http",0
