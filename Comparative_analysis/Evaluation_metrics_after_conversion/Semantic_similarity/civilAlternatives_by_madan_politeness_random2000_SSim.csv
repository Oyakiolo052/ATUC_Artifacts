Personally i think issue author is wrong in his thought that check should analyze code blocks and determine if there is an exit point. Issue  #616 (continue and break statements) is hard to solve because we have to store additional data about all loops we have entered (labeled break statements would be particulary hard), this is beyond stack calculator we have now.  Indeed the update is huge because i had to reclassify tokens according to th","ation as described in Nejmeh's article, issue #146 is unrelated. <ersonally i think issue author is wrong in his thought that check should analyze code blocks reclass and determine if there is an exitk point.Issue # 6 ( we need to be able to have to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to have an opportunity to",0.8589157462120056
