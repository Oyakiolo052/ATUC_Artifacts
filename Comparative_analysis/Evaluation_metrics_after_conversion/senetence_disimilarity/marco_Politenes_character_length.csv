Umm.. why did you assign this to me? This test is horrible - doesn't redirect anything to $TEST_log and doesn't even encapsulate its code in a test_* function so that the test framework probably won't work at all.

@user Thanks for the answer but I think the devil is in the details so let's go back to the specific example of `format`. Currently if set to `RGBA8888` on libGDX TexturePacker it will not output it because it's a default.   First question is:  where is this default value for `format` defined exactly so that libGDX sets it to `RGBA8888` when missing on the atlas? I would expect all defaults from the parser in one place.

"Ah crap, just found one more wrinkle in this:  http  Our docs mention that `cache.hash_algo` should be set to one of the `pbkdf_stretch_*` values in FIPS mode, i.e., _not_ `ssha256`.
