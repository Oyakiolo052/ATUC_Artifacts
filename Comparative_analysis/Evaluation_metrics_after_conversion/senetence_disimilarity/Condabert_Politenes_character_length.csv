@user Thanks for the answer but I think the devil is in the details so let's go back to the specific example of `format`. Currently if set to `RGBA8888` on libGDX TexturePacker it will not output it because it's a default.   First question is:  where is this default value for `format` defined exactly so that libGDX sets it to `RGBA8888` when missing on the atlas? I would expect all defaults from the parser in one place.  My second question was about opening on another 3rd party tool such as Texture Packer,@ user thanks for the answer but i think the devil is in the details so let ' s go back to the specific example of ` format ` . currently if set to ` rgba8888 ` on libgdx texturepacker it will not output it because it ' s a default . first question is : where is this default value for ` format ` defined exactly so that libgdx sets it to ` rgba8888 ` when missing on the atlas ? i would expect all defaults from the parser in one place . my second question was about opening on another 3rd party tool such as texture packer,0,-2.7450980392156863,-14,increase
