Now if S replies, his TS tries to establish a secure session (via SMS) first, thus whoever got a SMS group message through to S gets a key message.

"The load order is pretty much undefined, so I wouldn't rely on it.  Whether or not the map plugin breaks depends on the binary compatibility of the different versions, that's tricky to say.  What I've done in the past to work around issues like these was to include the library's code as a git submodule (from a fork) and then update the library to use a specific version. That's messy and requires tracking changes, but is often the only sane way to deal with jar hell.","The load order is pretty much undefined, so I wouldn't rely on it.

"@user but if you disable whole bean you won't be able inject it into tests so the only solution becomes the ugly  ```java @user public void start(ApplicationReadyEvent event) {     if (event.getApplicationContext().getEnvironment().acceptsProfiles(Profiles.of(""test"")))         return;     doSomething(); } ```  or separating listener to another bean which is also unnecessarily ugly.
