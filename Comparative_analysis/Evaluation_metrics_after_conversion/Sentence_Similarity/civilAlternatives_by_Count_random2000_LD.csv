"@user There's nothing crappy about your English level as far as I can tell.  There's no accessor for the data sources that are used by an `AbstractRoutingDataSources` so we can't automatically include the status of each of them. Instead, we recommend that you define a bean for each `DataSource` that the `AbstractRoutingDataSource` uses. Each will then have its own health indicator.

"The load order is pretty much undefined, so I wouldn't rely on it.  Whether or not the map plugin breaks depends on the binary compatibility of the different versions, that's tricky to say.  What I've done in the past to work around issues like these was to include the library's code as a git submodule (from a fork) and then update the library to use a specific version. That's messy and requires tracking changes, but is often the only sane way to deal with jar hell.","The load order is pretty much undefined, so I wouldn't rely on it. ",0,0.14255319148936174
