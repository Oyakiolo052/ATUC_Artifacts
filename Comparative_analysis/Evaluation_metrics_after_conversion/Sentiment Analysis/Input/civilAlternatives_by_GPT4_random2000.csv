I am reaching out to you in need of some guidance. Recently, I have been experiencing some challenges in establishing a connection. This is specifically with: [none -> pulsar://localhost:6650]. Unfortunately, my efforts to resolve the issue have been unfruitful as I keep getting a ""Connection Refused"" message.

Finally, we ensure the necessary key entry is present in 'serverKeyStore', specifically the one defined under the relevant alias from our SIP server settings bean. If it's not detected, we'll throw an IllegalArgumentException. We should definitely make sure that this key entry is in place, otherwise we run into this exception.",

In full screen mode, we only see the upper left portion of the viewport zoomed in according to the degree of the UI scaling.  2. Nearest Neighbor pixel rendering screws up and shows blurry pi","I am experiencing the same issue. In Windows 10, there's a functionality commonly referred to as UI Scaling. Details surrounding this feature can be found in this article: http. UI Scaling is quite helpful for those who may struggle with their vision as it magnifies the text and GUI elements in a majority of Windows applications.

Nevertheless, activating this feature triggers two rather detrimental effects regarding libGDX. Firstly, when operating in full-screen mode, it only reveals a zoomed-in view of the top left section of the viewport, the zoom detail corresponding directly to the scale of UI scaling. Secondly, it affects the Nearest Neighbor pixel rendering by rendering the pixel visualization blurry.",
"Most graphics subsystems max out around 30k pixels in either direction, so any time you're close to that, you're likely to run into trouble. Are you actually below 30k pixels in either dimension?   In other circumstances (i.e. a hidpi display, or sizing up), the limit can be even worse—around 15k pixels.  This is a funky OS limitation that we obviously can't control, but if we can figure out where it's failing, perhaps we can put in an error message or warning about it.","It appears that the majority of graphics subsystems have a maximum limit of approximately 30,000 pixels in either direction. Once these limits are approached, you may potentially experience issues. Could you maybe confirm whether your graphics dimension is, in fact, below 30,000 pixels? 

In other cases, such as using a high-definition display or trying to scale up, these maximum limits may be significantly less—perhaps around 15,000 pixels. These are inherent constraints of the operating system which we, unfortunately, have no control over. However, if we can identify at what point these issues are arising, we might be able to introduce a warning message or error notification to help manage this better.",

"Strong upvote here. For things like FlatBuffers (or I think even protobuf) that generate one file per table/struct, this is a big issue. The best options I can think of ATM are to write a custom rule and declare the output as a directory using `ctx.actions.declare_directory`, write a linter rule enforcing 1 struct per file with a matching name (which many devs are opposed to when there are several small dependent structs that aren't meant to be used separately) or as mentioned, write a custom build script","I highly agree with your sentiments. This is particularly applicable to utilities like FlatBuffers - and I also believe Protobuf - that typically generate one file for each table or struct, which tends to complicate matters. Some of the most feasible solutions I can currently suggest include creating a personalized rule and declaring the output as a directory via `ctx.actions.declare_directory`. An alternative could be formulating a linter rule that necessitates one struct per file with a corresponding name. However, this proposal may face opposition from numerous developers, especially when it involves several small interdependent structs that aren't designed for individual usage.

But what you're suggesting is far more extreme: you want the signature to change based on the values of the parameters.

Programming code doesn't really have a civil or impolite variation, it's written in a set structured way to give instructions to computer systems.

That said, if you're looking to discuss this code politely in conversation, you might say something like:

""I've noticed a small change that could optimize the checking process here. Rather than having separate if-statements to check if 'dynamicType' is null and if 'matchMappingType' doesn't match with 'dynamicType', we could condense these validations into one line. This might help to improve the readability and performance of our code, and it’s essentially the same logic that we initially had.""",
"> I do think it is strange having graylog rename fields for backwards compatibility which is no longer required. The field rename has confused me with parsing rules now more than once until I look at the raw input/field value(because of the way the graylog web interface shows the renamed value).  The backwards compatibility concern really is that we cannot silently change behavior in running setups. I fully understand that for new users this seems silly, but that's the nature of supporting decisions from ","the past. 

Civil version: 

Pardon me for saying this, but I find it somewhat unusual to have Graylog rename fields for a backwards compatibility that is perhaps no longer necessary. The renaming process tends to create some confusion for me when it comes to parsing rules, and I've encountered this issue more than once. I generally have to refer back to the raw input or field value to clarify matters, as the Graylog web interface primarily displays the renamed value.

I see the rationale behind maintaining this status quo to ensure existing settings aren't inadvertently altered. It's comprehensible that new users might perceive this as unnecessary, but to my understanding, this is part of accommodating decisions made previously.",

" particularly empowering though as the user can't see it themselves and one of the reason the HTML/JS debugging works well (it has in the past) for people willing to work is that it requires no coordination with anyone - it's all self-contained  Maybe ""turn debug logging on"" and ""save debug log to file"" that does an SAF save file intent with logcat filter query contents, and still maybe a send error report.

This probable preferred component of HTML/JS debugging, which has proven effective in the past, appeals to people who are inclined to put in the effort mainly because it doesn't necessitate any form of coordination. It's entirely self-sufficient.

Perhaps implementing features such as ""activate debug logging"" and ""store debug log in a file"" which could execute an SAF save file directive filled with logcat filtered query contents might be a viable option.

To enhance the user experience, it's important to consider various strategies for building user trust in the numbers, particularly in relation to the inherent ambiguities associated with the use of these applications and providing the necessary context.

Moreover, as we venture into the world of BI, it’s crucial to recognize that search engines and databases have different functionalities. Search engines are constructed to produce a range of results without necessarily pinpointing an exact response. Consequently, it is essential that users understand that the outputs generated can fluctuate considerably depending on the input query in our search applications.",

@user Thanks for the answer but I think the devil is in the details so let's go back to the specific example of `format`. Currently if set to `RGBA8888` on libGDX TexturePacker it will not output it because it's a default.   First question is:  where is this default value for `format` defined exactly so that libGDX sets it to `RGBA8888` when missing on the atlas? I would expect all defaults from the parser in one place.  My second question was about opening on another 3rd party tool such as Texture Packer,"@user, I appreciate your response. However, I believe a closer look into the intricate details would allow us to understand better, particularly in the case of the `format` setting. For example, when set to `RGBA8888` on libGDX TexturePacker, it appears that it doesn't facilitate any output due to it being the default.

To clarify my understanding a bit further, may I ask where precisely the default value for `format` is defined? In other words, how does libGDX identify `RGBA8888` as the default when the atlas lacks this input? My anticipations were along the lines of finding all default settings derived from the parser in a singular location.

My second question pertains to another aspect, revolving around the utilization of a different third-party tool such as Texture Packer. Can we discuss this subject too?",

Even Josh Bloch doesn't use it http :smile:   > I guess if we wanted to we could get rid of the comparators and use IntObjectMap.  I don't see why it makes sense to use an `IntObjectMap` for this. That's one of the reason why the current headers use so much memory. We would need an `ObjectToObjectMap`.,"While using a `LinkedList` in Java might present some inefficiency issues, it's interesting to note that a two-element `LinkedList` requires the same memory allocation as a 10-element `ArrayList`. Even esteemed software engineer, Josh Bloch, prefers not to utilize it. 

As for the use of comparators and the possible switch to an `IntObjectMap`, my perspective remains doubtful regarding its effectiveness. From my observation, heavy memory usage from the current headers could be ascribed partially to the use of an `IntObjectMap`. Maybe adopting an `ObjectToObjectMap` could present a more memory-efficient approach.",

I noticed the code you posted regarding the `uhOh()` function. It seems that you've created two instances of Hazelcast and are adding an integer to a list named 'list'. You're also printing out the sizes of the list before and after adding the number.

ES client is not content with that version due to some new log4j2 API changes I guess so what are the options:  - replace all log4j2 2.1 jars on the Storm cluster with 2.7 - attempt to roll a shaded *.jar which packs log4j2 2.7 with relocation of `org.apache.logging.log4j`moved to different location, `META-INF","We are currently utilizing the ES 5.x client within our Storm topology programming. The Storm distribution includes log4j2 2.1, which is an integral element of all Storm processes throughout the cluster. It appears that the ES client may not be compatible with this version, possibly due to updates in log4j2 API. Given these circumstances, we are exploring what our potential solutions might be, namely:

- The option of replacing all instances of log4j2 2.1 jars across the Storm cluster with the version 2.7
- Alternatively, we are considering creating a shaded *.jar that comprises log4j2 2.7, with `org.apache.logging.log4j` subsequently relocated to a different location, i.e., `META-INF. 

Would this be a feasible solution for us?",

"Anything ""new SQL stuff"" which contains named parameters like `NULL`, `ON` or other keywords can easily create trouble for the parser.

Modified version:

1. @user stated: 

> From my understanding, we already have a circumstance where the whitespace only mode conducts the checks when we're transpiling from ES6 to DJS3 or 5. Thus, it seems logical to perform the check unconditionally and integrate this process at the start of getChecks in DefaultPassConfig. What I noticed is that you have:
  - A method for ""Do Checks?"" known as doChecks().
  - Various conditions to ""skip non-transpilation passes"". Under these, checks get bypassed and only transpilation occurs.

However, on a different note,

  - Transpilation is not exactly the same as performing ""checks"". Hence, it doesn't feel completely right.
  - Furthermore, it's possible that we might be able to postpone some of these checks until later stages if necessary. So, wouldn't it be beneficial to evade any superfluous checks?

"> Is there a workaround I can use? Or should I simply downgrade back to 1.5.2?  We consider this issue very serious. As soon as I get the necessary review from other team members, I intend to release 1.5.4 with a fix. I hope to do that this week still.  You can workaround that particular issue in the meantime by registering a second `Validator`. If there are more than one `Validator` bean in the context, then you'll bypass the faulty condition.

    }

    @Override
    public void validate(Object target, Errors errors) {

However, it seems this PR has not been updated recently, hence we must regard it as stale since its latest update was on 2020-01-01T06:37:20Z, and it currently lacks a 'stale' label.

Considering this, I've taken the liberty to mark issue #5489 - the one concerning the prevention of cards' import into a filtered deck - as stale.

On digging deeper, I found a 'stale' PR and am currently evaluating its label status on issue #5489. For the records, issue #5489 was officially marked as 'stale' on: 2020-06-02T22:37:36Z. In the interest of thoroughness, I am in the process of checking if there have been any comments on issue #5489 since this 'stale' status was applied on 2020-06-02T22:37:36Z. However, as per my findings till now, no comments have been made for issue #5489 since the said date.",

" really should never make it out the door   There's no JAR hell check to prevent `gradle assemble` from succeeding, though, so it was easy for me to have this fail.

The situation at hand is related to the absence of a JAR hell check as a part of the `gradle assemble` process.

We should consider removing BitShares derivatives from our portfolio.

It's essential that we encourage a culture of due diligence where individuals actually investigate the code, examine the backers, read the internet reports, and thoroughly consider the security aspects. For if we don't do so, these unsuspecting individuals might fall prey to unscrupulous activities. Eventually, the question we need to ask ourselves is: Do we merely want to appear responsible by playing the role of a pseudo-government and ban what we consider might potentially harm others? Or do we genuinely want to nurture a sense of responsibility by providing appropriate tools to every individual, leaving the decision-making in their own capable hands?

It turned out that: - there is a lot of places using static-context logging - manual already mentions this problem  I limited work on this issue to: - switching static-context logging to node-based logging wherever possible - fixing logger static-context init section to invoke it as early as possible - fixing logger static-context init section to take custom factory under consideration (a bug before)  Recommendations: - User node-based logger wherever possible - Logger.getLogger() can be used in special c,"Upon reviewing the situation, it was discovered that static-context logging is utilized in several places. Interestingly, the manual has already highlighted this particular issue. Given these circumstances, my focus for this issue was predominately limited to the following areas:

1. I worked on shifting from static-context logging to node-based logging as much as possible.
2. I endeavored to amend the logger's static-context initialization section to ensure it was invoked as early as possible.
3. I also worked on adjusting the logger's static-context initialization section to take custom factories into account, as this had previously been overlooked and was causing a bug.

Recommendations moving forward:

1. It is advisable to switch to node-based logger whenever feasible.
2. In exceptional circumstances, Logger.getLogger() may be utilized.",

Please note a few changes I've noticed in the code from lines 581 to 583, and onwards.

Instead of calling the error, it's caught within an IOException e. In the case where logger.isWarnEnabled becomes active, the logger warns with the error messgae ""Error while closing a pipe"", and this is followed by the parameter e.

Also, in the update, I see the inclusion of a new function called safeShutdownPipe. This function, which accepts int pipe as a parameter, is designed to close the pipe safely only when the pipe value isn't -1. Similar to the previous code, it catches an IOException and triggers a warning if logger is enabled.

Looking for your feedback and confirmation on these updates. Thanks.",

Subject: Suggestions Regarding DELETE Availability for APIs

Dear {name},

Hope this message finds you well.

I have been giving much thought to our current system format and would like to propose two potential options to consider:

Option 1: 

We could consider extending the availability of the `DELETE` command to three APIs, similar to its current functionality in `_warmer`. This might look like:

```
DELETE index/_mapping|_alias|_warmer/name 
DELETE index/_mapping|_alias|_warmer/prefix* 
DELETE index/_mapping|_alias|_warmer/
```
This alteration could potentially streamline some processes, by allowing the `DELETE` command to serve a more comprehensive purpose.

Option 2:

Alternatively, we could choose to retain our existing structure as is. This option does not offer the extents of modification suggested in Option 1, yet it also requires no adaptation on part of the team.

Please feel free to share your thoughts on these suggestions. Both options have their merits, and I welcome your input to help determine which may be the most beneficial for our system's overall efficiency and functionality.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best Regards,

[Your Name]",

While I understand your point and respect your perspective, it may be beneficial to also consider another angle.

"Yeah, having examined this I can only reach one realistic conclusion:  Signal got too big and too popular, and so somebody decided to limit it, and bribed or threatened the devs to destroy it, coming up with a very effective strategy of removing existing functional features to make it unusable by the majority of non-technical users.  It's also possible they took over the project, hiring bad actors to contribute until they controlled, and again sabotaged it from the inside.  Either way, it it my opinion th","After careful examination, it seems to me that due to its popularity, Signal may have undergone some modifications to regulate its usage.

Our current setup does include a finalize function in Memory, which operates as a safety net in case an explicit free instruction is missed. The downside is that finalize tends to work slower, although it doesn't come into play very frequently. 

The main issue we encounter is the Out of Memory errors which can occur due to the system's failure to reclaim objects pending finalization during a specific Garbage Collection phase. Having larger objects would only further complicate this situation. Right now, the StupidPool feature for ByteBuffers is configured to allocate ByteBuffers equivalent to the number of ResourceHolders. It might be worth discussing the impact and potential benefits of modifying this resource allocation pattern.",

Taking everything into consideration with EB, there is indeed quite a bit to manage given that we already have to take into account a multitude of variables. Moreover, we are also dealing with the addition of a few milliseconds here and there. Nonetheless, given the broader picture, these rare maximums are still rather minimal.

While keeping in mind the specific case we are looking at, Go 1.0.3 at 256 concurrency, it's possible there might be some requests exceeding 2,000ms, an aspect which may have escaped the notice of the Wrk latency sampler. This could hint towards a minor garbage collection hiccup.

In future, I am eager to delve deeper into the reason why it isn't possible for Wrk to review each completed request individually and calculate the latency separately. However, I do admit that this is indeed a different issue altogether.",

- You're keeping the connection alive, right? The cache has a maximum element of 200 and the identification is set as 2, is this your desired configuration?
- Moving onto `FD_ALL`, having time service enabled enhances performance, a good decision indeed. You've set statistical gathering as active, set the timeout check interval at 1000 and the interval at 2000. And you've set the identification as 20 with a timeout of 10000.

Without a doubt. To give you an idea, the zip file I have includes two 7Z files. The one generated from my Mac entails over 300mb of error output, whereas the output from my Windows machines occupies around 1/100th of that, due to my predominant utilization of Windows for .NET programming.

I hope this message finds you well. As I was going through some records, I found that there were entries in the ""es_is_not_a_db"" that features the following data: the 'id' as 1, 'name' respectively as 'Joe' and 'Bob', and 'rank' as 'Worker Bee'. 

Furthermore, I conducted a count and sum calculation on the 'failures' as well as a coalesce function, which would provide a zero output if there were any NULL values. Peculiarly, the results were as follows:

Count: 0
Sum: Null 
Coalesce: 0

I would be thrilled to see a proposal that aims to reduce around 90% of the content currently available on the seleniumhq.org site.

For that, we have Integer.MAX_VALUE. If you review the getMaxSize method of the config, you'll even note that 0 is converted to Integer.MAX_VALUE. Here's the implementation for reference:

"@user You need to add `.toWebElement()`:  ```java actions().moveToElement($("".gsfi"").toWebElement()).perform(); ```  The point is that `$("".gsfi"")` is not a ""real"" `WebElement`, but a proxy object (created by Selenide).

However, the actions builder behaves differently as it does not use conventional methods but rather relies on a more intricate process (which unfortunately falls flat with the proxy object). Specifically, the actions builder calls `BeanToJsonConverter` which utilizes reflection and iterates all the properties of the given object. I hope this clarification helps!",

Also happening when comparing the results of two method calls that return long.  For example:  ```java class Crap {     private final long val      public long getVal() { return val } }  if (c1.getVal() != c2.getVal()) {  // <-- here     // whatever } ```,"You may encounter similar issues when comparing the results of two method calls that return a 'long' response. Let's take a look at an example for a better understanding:

```java
class Example {
    private final long val;
    
    public long getVal() {
        return val;
    }
}

if (example1.getVal() != example2.getVal()) { 
    // some actions
}
```
In the 'if' condition here, if the value obtained via method call from 'example1' and 'example2' is not equal, the system will execute a specific set of actions. Thereby indicating this scenario can also happen in case of long method call responses.",

In a recent discussion with @user, we dove into the fundamental objectives of the `Sequence` abstraction, primarily focusing on resource management. @user commemorated its effectiveness, mentioning that there have been very few occasions where Druid faced a query-associated resource leak.

"This is unfortunate. I understand the motivation, but as a user experience it's pretty poor. Unfortunately, this is in practice with a user that does not use Signal for both SMS and Signal. The poor experience in this case looks like a conversation starting in SMS but switching mid conversation to Signal causing a jarring experience or missed conversation.  i.e.:  | SMS app | Signal | | ------------ | --------- | | user1: ""HEY! Let's go get some drinks"" | | | user2: ""YEAH! What time and where?"" | | | | us","er1: ""How about 8 at the pub?"" | |

It's quite regrettable to note this situation. Even though the intention behind it is understandable, it seems that the user experience could potentially be improved. It appears especially so for users who don't utilize Signal for both SMS and Signal itself. A less than satisfactory experience could be perceived where a conversation starts in SMS and then suddenly switches to Signal. This abrupt transition could disorient the user, or even lead to part of the conversation being missed. For instance, the scenario could look like this: 

In the SMS app, user1 sends, ""Let's go get some drinks."" User2 responds with, ""What time and where?"" However, user1's next message moves to Signal, where they reply, ""How about 8 at the pub?""",

"_From jweissma...@gmail.com on October 17, 2010 07:33:37_ Stumbled across this   ``` // If not the preprocessed file at this point, then need to get out if (!dotJavaFilename.equals(name + "".java"")) {   return null; } ```  and realized I'm mixing .java with .pde files. I'm not sure how this is handled behind the scenes, but if you're trying to reproduce it, you may want to try that.  The reason I'm doing this, by the way, is to allow enums. I thought originally about making an issue for that, but the worka","rounds available to me thus far haven't been ideal. 

### Enhanced Version:

Greetings,

While browsing, I happened upon the following line of code: 

``` 
// If not the preprocessed file at this point, then need to get out 
if (!dotJavaFilename.equals(name + "".java"")) { 
  return null; 
} 
``` 
Upon further inspection, I noticed that I was inadvertently intertwining .java files with .pde ones. I'm not entirely certain how this specific matter is addressed backend, however, if anyone is attempting to replicate it, you may find it beneficial to keep this in mind.

The motivation behind my decision to intermix .java with .pde files, for your reference, is to facilitate the usage of enums. Initially, I contemplated opening a discussion regarding this matter, but alas the workarounds I've come across up till this point have not proven to be particularly favourable.",

While I genuinely appreciate your love for Kotlin, I must say that the example you provide in your original post does strike me somewhat unfamiliar. The alternative syntax you suggest seems to disrupt conventional code aesthetics, at least from my perspective. 

If I may propose a slight revision to illustrate my point: 
For instance, the following chunk of code,
``` 
if (a) return X 
else if (b) return Y 
else return Z 
``` 
still communicates intention clearly when re-written into:
 ``` 
return if (a) X 
else if (b) Y 
else Z 
``` 
However, I personally find the softer appeal in this version of your `getSomeValue` function: 
```
int getSomeValue(@Nonnull Boolean isA, Float b) { 
    if (isA) { 
        return 1 
    } else if (b != null && b > 5) { 
        return 2 
    } else { 
        return 3 
    } 
} 
```
Rather than the code you've provided,
```
fun getSomeValue(isA: Boolean, b: Float?): Int { 
    return when { 
        isA -> 1 
        b != null && b > 5 -> 2 
        else -> 3 
    } 
} 
```

"So here's my guess what's going on: S has only recently signed up, the other phones do not yet know he's able to receive push messages (synced every 12 hours, if online). Thus, everyone is sending S SMS (or MMS) messages instead of push messages. Now if S replies, his TS tries to establish a secure session (via SMS) first, thus whoever got a SMS group message through to S gets a key message.  For the rest it just works since everything is done via push. Encrypted SMS sucks.","I am assuming the following might be happening: It seems like S has just recently joined and the other phone users might not be aware of his ability to receive push messages yet, as this usually takes around 12 hours to synchronise properly when online. As a result, everyone is probably sending S SMS or MMS messages in place of push messages. When S responds, his TS attempts to set up a secure session first, which is typically done using SMS. Consequently, any user who had successfully sent an SMS group message to S receives a key message. Everything else seems to function correctly as it's all done through push messages.

The main intent of using AsciiString is to reduce the expense associated with committing a string constant to a ByteBuf. It's clear that copying byte[] into ByteBuf is significantly speedier than ah string into ByteBuf. However, I hadn't been focusing on the memory overhead, but your point about the 12-16 byte overhead being relatively substantial here, is valid. I will certainly look into this. Incidentally, using the deprecated constructor does seem to warrant my attention here. Let's see how we can work around this for a better outcome.",

Following this, please do consider checking out to 'master', fetching the upstream, and executing a hard rebase on 'upstream/master'. Subsequently, a git push should be performed to mirror your local state to the server. 

Next, you may consider checking out 'material-design-2018' and rebasing it onto master. Do keep your fingers crossed here, as this is the step that could potentially raise conflicts if any are to occur. Once done, please push the changes.

This is what causes problem with date values:  ``` Unrecognized type 'java.sql.Date' - can't convert to numeric ```  DBeaver thinks that this column has numeric data type. This is because you second column has the same alias as the real table column (date_key). DBeaver tries to discover real attribute data type from database metadata whenever it is possible. Smarty pants.  Workaround - set some alias for your expression. And I'll think how to handle this problem better..,"It seems that the issue with the date values is being caused by an unrecognized type 'java.sql.Date', which the system is unable to convert to numeric. The program DBeaver appears to interpret that this particular column consists of numeric data. Interestingly, this may be resulting from the second column having the same alias as the original table column (date_key). In its attempt to discern the true attribute data type from the provided database metadata, DBeaver might have encountered this confusion. 

A fascinating point of observation, really. 

In the meantime, a potential workaround might be to designate an alias for your expression. Rest assured, I'll also take some time to consider how this situation might be better managed in the future.",

Compare Autocrypt security design with that of Signal messenger protocol. Imho no need to waste r,"time on this, as this won't improve the security of communications in the long-term.

1. When it comes to spoof email addresses, I would suggest we refrain from it.

I personally don't see the necessity for an Autocrypt 2.0.

"@user  > We'd have used it if we liked the API better but we don't.  Dude...  Hello, the fact that ES 5.x `org.elasticsearch.client` transport artifact explicitly expects log4j2 2.7 made things quite hard for us. I don't understand the exact reason it's not using the slf4j API. Using `log4j-over-slf4j` is not an option since there will very likely be `log4j-slf4j-impl` in the class path to process the logs of ""standard"" libraries that don't make an explicit choice about the logging framework.  Our particu","lar setup doesn't quite allow for it. 

Perhaps, @user  > We did contemplate on utilizing it, yet the API didn't quite resonate with our preferences. Respectfully, we encountered a degree of difficulty due to the ES 5.x `org.elasticsearch.client` transport artifact explicitly requiring log4j2 2.7. It was somewhat unclear to me why the slf4j API was not being utilized. We found using `log4j-over-slf4j` infeasible as we anticipate the presence of `log4j-slf4j-impl` in the classpath for processing the logs of standard libraries that don't expressly choose the logging framework. Our current setup just doesn't seem to permit it.",

"I feel as if I'm not explaining the issue properly.  I'm not asking for the plugin architecture to be rethought, but one of several relatively simple solutions to be considered:  1. There should be an ""upgrade"" or ""reinstall"" options for `elasticsearch-plugin`. Two commands required to upgrade a single plugin is pretty crazy. 2. An `elasticsearch-plugin` command to upgrade or reinstall *all* plugins wouldn't be the worst idea. Iterate through all plugins, and perform an uninstall and reinstall. 3. Potenti","ally, the `elasticsearch-plugin` could allow for version information to be specified so that plugins can be upgraded or reinstalled without the need for uninstallation. I hope these suggestions can be given some consideration.

Apologies if I've failed to explain my concerns clearly. I am not seeking an overhaul of the plugin architecture, but rather a consideration of several straightforward solutions. 

Firstly, it would be immensely helpful to incorporate 'upgrade' or 'reinstall' functionality into `elasticsearch-plugin`. The necessity for two commands to upgrade a single plugin is a tad cumbersome. 

Secondly, an `elasticsearch-plugin` command facilitating the upgrade or reinstallation of all plugins simultaneously is a worthy consideration. The command could iterate through all plugins, performing an uninstall and reinstall sequentially. 

Finally, another suggestion is for `elasticsearch-plugin` to support the specification of version information, thereby enabling plugins to be upgraded or reinstalled without necessitating uninstallation. 

I trust these proposals will be taken into consideration. Thank you.",
"Ahh shucks. It seems that GCC's cc1 and cc1plus couldn't find the necessary libcloog-isl library. An unfortunate result of the way the admin's have set up so users have multiple GCC compilers available, requiring that LD_LIBRARY_PATH be set to use them (which is automatically set by some magic shell scripts of theirs).  I ended up writing some sad little shell wrappers to call gcc, cpp, cc1 and cc1plus with the necessary LD_LIBRARY_PATH set, and this resolved the issue.  A more principled solution would h","ave been to modify the GCC build to link the necessary libraries statically, but that would require admin intervention, hence my workaround. 

It's quite unfortunate; the administrators' design that allows users to switch between different versions of GCC entails users to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. This results from specific automated shell scripts they've implemented.

For resolution, I resorted to creating small yet functional shell wrappers. This facilitative step allowed me to call gcc, cpp, cc1 and cc1plus with the provision of a set LD_LIBRARY_PATH, successfully resolving the existing issue. 

Ideally, a more systematic solution would involve modifying the GCC build to statically link the requisite libraries. However, such an undertaking would necessitate administrative intervention, which is why I pursued a workaround instead.",

"@user correct me if I am wrong, but jar hell conflict can happen not just between a plugin and elasticsearch, but between 2 plugins.

Previously, I came up with a somewhat ill-advised idea to bypass this check on static methods. In my view, static methods should function as utility methods within a class. Hence, these utility methods should either log all issues or suppress any issues without any grey areas - such as the conversion of a string to an integer, for instance.

Additionally, it appears that there were tasks to be run in a 'ScheduledRunnable', which also led to some problems. Finally, a 'FutureTask' at Java concurrent library attempted to run and contributed to the overall issue. As such, I recommend checking each of these classes to identify and rectify the error.",

It creates a variable called 'mapName' with the value ""test"". Then it creates a 'config' instance, and two 'Hazelcast' instances, one acting as a server, another as a client.

A map is created on the server where ""test"" is added as both a key and its corresponding value. Also, on the client side, we create another map with the same name.

Finally, we print out a statement indicating that we're fetching the keyset from the client map and finish by printing ""done"" to signify completion.

@user 
public void start(ApplicationReadyEvent event) {     
    if (event.getApplicationContext().getEnvironment().acceptsProfiles(Profiles.of(""test"")))         
        return;     
    doSomething(); 
}
```

Alternatively, you might consider pruning the listener to another bean, but in some cases, this solution might result in less optimal aesthetics. I have a warmup service that, if not disabled, is going to run for each test. However, I still harbor an interest in testing it single-handedly, just once.",

"if 100% coverage is not reachable in normal workflow we try to use PowerMock, if it can not help also, we use ugly reflection.

Well, I can not speak for the TextSecure developers, but:  IMHO the Google ""Noto Color Emoji"" Emoji set looks like shi*.

Depending on the product version may have contributed to the error - as you're using a beta version. 

@user made a point regarding Apple emojis saying, 

""Why have you switched to using Apple emojis?""

In response to that, I can't really offer a direct answer as it's not my decision. However, it might be due to the general preference. The Google ""Noto Color Emoji"" set is not visually appealing to everyone, according to general consensus. 

That being said, many people do not favor the Google ""Noto Color Emoji"" interface. If you're doubtful about the sentiment, maybe you could refer to the comments from these two threads on the AOSP issue tracker:
