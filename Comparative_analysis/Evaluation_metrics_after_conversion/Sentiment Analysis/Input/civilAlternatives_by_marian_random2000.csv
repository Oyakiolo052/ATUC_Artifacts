"@user @user I've backported these changes to 7.x. This actually accomplishes two things. We have the configuration time bonus in 7.x. It makes backporting other build changes, especially those that touch buildPlugin, much easier since this is a significant change. The loss of 7x is that it still supports the JDK 8 runtime, resulting in a poor load of conditionals in the runtime java version, which is now closer.

Additionally, you haven't provided any information where the exact.play()'/'.loop()' that causes the issue. By providing the required information and adhere to SSCCE guidelines, you're making solving the issue harder for everyone, including yourself."

By the way, You should see RemoveException somewhere so you know a remote call occurred. (Alwayas painful to identify which the exception was discarded.)"

"@user, I kindly request that you review my last post again. It's perfectly reasonable, and I agree that typing a password to send an email is quite annoying. I'll try to remove it somewhere down the route, but it will take a while.

One of them is dealing with sales VPS for expected results, and they accept crypto. The ""Suggester"" is not perfect, and it's important to acknowledge their success."

"I noticed a couple sub- minutes ones, and on the main, it took two'41"" and timeout for 5' should be adequate. It's challenging to retry on this one; the retry action I'm familiar with doesn't wrap actions only commands and performing a retry on an action requires multiple attempts with status setting and checking (a true workflowje regarding code). So, setting a timeout and failing quickly, given the current occurrence of this one, seems like a good solution to address this issue."

"It might lead to Tomcat to logging an error (or a warning) at startup. However, I believe enabling http by default and documenting that unless the selected server's native support library is installed or Java 9 is in usage, HTTP/2 won't be enabled is the most suitable option. While I could agree that enabling HTTP/2 by default is the recommended approach, it would be beneficial to avoid the oversight message from Tomcat.

"Hmm, I remember why I was asked to open this issue back then. However, considering it now, I don't believe logging at the tail end (e.g., the video-provider component) is the correct approach. If we want to understand that something was closed due to a lock setting or breakout room thing, then we log the root action (e.g., lock Camer, and enter breakout room) and then we use logeration to link it to the tail end (e.g., video_provider's stop log). To clarify this issue, it would be helpful to have proper defined screen sharing and error-related scenarios."
"similar to the same type. It would be beneficial to go solidly in this case or in the other (lexer or lexer+tree). The simplerNode partial approach is not acceptable. Although the Visualer is still not removed, the designers is what you should be using, and it is fully dynamic to support any AST production Language. which would be a non-issue. According to my previous comment, the manual mods to generated code should still be unnecessary. I can ensure its workaround if we introduce a AST scripts."

I'm already experiencing this. It's important to address it and find a way to move forward constructively.
"It would be beneficial to break the code. Afterward, we need to repositing any run after it (just a position; don't need getGlyfs again), until we get back to the original run that didn't fit.

"I don't intend to support this task at the moment. We have a challenging time with supporting the following: bin/elasticsearch and mvn test. These are the only two ways we can currently support ES. While there are a million other ways people want to run it, they are in a dreamland because we have larger issues like jar hell and plugins not working at all. Once the basics are working, we can examine the nice-to-haves and consider their maintenance costs."

"he ""ToS"" option is not legal; it simply implies that if you violate their services, you may have the freedom to retain their services to you, such as termination your account and blocking the IP if they are extra-media. It would be non-virtual if you agree with the ""ToS"" by using their services through their official clients.

"Instead of committing to an API defining how we interpret those files, I would strongly prefer the need for either a preprocessing step that converts them into.bzl or a repository rule, as suggested by @user. The problem with my workaround is that it's cumbersome, even you are a bazel expert.

"It would be beneficial to use fiat currency enough trades, which is the only value of glitch or USD. We calculated the historical price based on those trades.

"Let's translate that directly into Java code by parsing ""true"" to ""true"" and ""false"" to ""false"" with any other use of exception.

"he term ""--define"" is not just ""goog.define's."" Additionally, you can use non-Closure@define's (like ""COMPILED"" in base.js). A bundle won't replace these defines, and it doesn't make sense for them to access ""CloURE_[UNCOMPILED_]DE FINSES."" It would be confusing if ""--define"" always set the Closure defines as a result. There are work arounds, obviously. You can pass an input to the compiler that sets ""CLOURE_[UNCOMPILED_]DE FINSES"" and it would result in output that to the bundle and respect that in a compile."

However, actions builder doesn't call ""usual"" methods, but uses black magic (which fails with the proxy object).

It would be great if you could provide more details about the implementation of this video downloader. It would be even better to address the concerns and benefits of open source projects.
It has gone haywire now. We need to investigate and address the issue promptly.
Let's clean up two parts of code for better maintainability.
"he regexes in the lexer is relatively complex to run, but we can proceed with it. Although it makes the lexer more complex to read, it might be simpler to run. Since modes don't inherit from each other, we would need to copy and rename it. It quad-rubples the size of the lexer because we need to specify every mode transition and most token's types. twice."
"Since the decider is part of the balancing process, the allocator will attempt to identify the ""best"" weights that still satisfy all the deciders, so it will attempt to balance the shards evenly, but will still allow a allocation of pairs in event of the disk limit was reached on a specific machine or set of machines. > Have you considered this matter? Or should we try to break this with some challenging tests? It should already be taken into account, but it's always appreciated considering these tests."
"It seems you're already discussed before, but I'm not finding where or when the necessity of numbering the button comes. It's challenging for a code editor to modify markups created by the user. In this case, the reference label could be descriptive, rather than a number, which is associated with a paragraph, annotation, and phrase that can be moved to another position in a file or even another file or section. If necessary, this change from label to number should be, in the render process of change."

"Personally, I'm more useful tasks. Instead, let's focus on addressing the concerns we encounter, as a popular free software app, and ensure that people add negative votes to bad copies. This can enhance the visibility of NewPpipe as the original project.

As a small extra, when I file a bug here I don't expect a specific person to pick it up, it's filed for whoever is part of the dev team r"
Oof.
Super-weird.  Please post installation details. Main menu->Help->Installation Information->Configuration
"> @user are you exporting the subscriptions from NewPipe or Google Takeout? If it's the latter, this wouldn't be a NewPipe issue (see #5026).   Google Takeout. But I just figured it out. I'm a bloody idiot. On Google Takeout my default account was selected and since it's VERY old and during the Google+ days my youtube account got separated from my original main google account (kinda a sub-account but linked with the original). So I choose basically an empty youtube account and not the one linked to it. On"
"@user That'd be great, but someone needs to volunteer to write the WP client.  Right now us Android folks are slammed."
be you need to get the security constraint lifted so that the JDK can access its own library classes?
Is someone experiencing the same issue or am I doing something wrong?
"I hate the Android tools so much. Tomski, can you fix it up? If not, i can give it a whirl tomorrow."
" we are until runtime.  I'm going to exit the issue, I don't think i will be very helpful.   I just repeat, look here: http  Why is expressions 50% faster than painless? It generates the equivalent code. The difference is that expressions bypasses the scripting API.   I find it ironic we don't seem to care about leaving 50% performance on the table, yet at the same time fork a joda-time class (causing immense engineering frustrations) so that a date operation will be 10% faster."
"The formatting on this is horrible, could you run the libgdx formatter?"
Oh. Oops.
Errgh. That Tomcat thing is a bit of pain. I wonder if they would be interested in offering a version of the embedded jar that doesn't contain any `javax.*` packages?
"best issue ever, omg lmaoo"
"Damn, used the wrong formatter... I will try to fix it."
Argh... This moment you discover you were working in an outdated dir containing an outdated version of the project! What a shame... :)
"Maybe not turn off but close. You know, from task manager. Close, turn off - this is the same thing, right?  So when app is closed (turned off) and set as default messaging app all incoming messages are sucked by ""black hole"". I don't get any notification. And there is no way to read those missed messages, I just don't see them."
Great! Glad we finally got a handle on this.

"its 2020, I'm on linux mint, dbeaver community version 7 and this bullshit is still unresolved even by trying the stuff above... why the frickin hell do I have to go through debugging this stuff right after installing mariadb???"
"I rebased this PR. However, I screwed up while doing so. As a result my new commits are trash. Sorry for that."
"As designed above (cancel trade) is a simplistic ""I fucked up, here take my money and call it quits"" approach.  Mediation **works better** because it is more flexible both in negotiation and payout.  @user Thanks - what you describe above is exactly what I implemented.  Having tried it I think it is inflexible and would not be used because users think they are losing a lot of money and can get a better deal from mediation.  ---  My current thoughts: For users to resolve the trade between themselves, allow"
" different than if ""abc"" is stored as binary? I don't have a deep understanding of these things, but I figure the bytes stored would be `97 98 99` either way."
"@user There's nothing crappy about your English level as far as I can tell.  There's no accessor for the data sources that are used by an `AbstractRoutingDataSources` so we can't automatically include the status of each of them. Instead, we recommend that you define a bean for each `DataSource` that the `AbstractRoutingDataSource` uses. Each will then have its own health indicator. In 2.4, we've made an enhancement so that you can then [configure the routing data source to be ignored](https://github.com/s"
"ting mails so I don't get a notification for that crap <.<  I get the point about not wanting to maintain multiple lists, but in the end should this be a choice of the user, in my opinion atleast."
how did you scale your mongodb?
LOL
"> however as currently implemented I don't think that's what the results really reflect, due to the fact that the EL may not have returned to its original state prior to the subsequent burst coming in.  Totally agree: I suppose at this point that the benchmark needs to be redesigned to account of it...or maybe not :P  The whole point of this benchmark was to measure/observe the ""user experience"" and that's what a user would experience indeed; if that's obtained by luck (of timing) that's an implementation"
"`2016-09-10` regardless of user zone.  What you want seems to be something like  ``` select date_trunc('day', timestamp '2016-09-09 16:00:00 Z' AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Hong_Kong') select date_trunc('day', timestamp '2016-09-10 00:00:00 Asia/Hong_Kong' AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Hong_Kong') ```"
"The load order is pretty much undefined, so I wouldn't rely on it.  Whether or not the map plugin breaks depends on the binary compatibility of the different versions, that's tricky to say.  What I've done in the past to work around issues like these was to include the library's code as a git submodule (from a fork) and then update the library to use a specific version. That's messy and requires tracking changes, but is often the only sane way to deal with jar hell."

"@user but if you disable whole bean you won't be able inject it into tests so the only solution becomes the ugly  ```java @user public void start(ApplicationReadyEvent event) {     if (event.getApplicationContext().getEnvironment().acceptsProfiles(Profiles.of(""test"")))         return;     doSomething(); } ```  or separating listener to another bean which is also unnecessarily ugly.  I have a warmup service and if I don't disable it, it's going to execute for every test but I still want to test it once so "
"> a bit scary  Yeah! I believe it! Its weird to have these three, but I'm not sure of a better way to do this. I think we lucked out that this worked properly before the query/filter merger."
"if 100% coverage is not reachable in normal workflow we try to use PowerMock, if it can not help also, we use ugly reflection. That is not very good in general but we do this only in test area of code and we get increasable value from 100% coverage so we are ok to damage code clearness in test are. Extra comment should be placed to explain design.   You can find bunch of examples of complicated streams mocking and ugly reflection in our test."
Are you using the latest computer version?
" fault. It's yours (because you are using a beta version).  > @user wrote in http >  > Why on earth did you switch to Apple emojis?!  Well, I can not speak for the TextSecure developers, but:  IMHO the Google ""Noto Color Emoji"" Emoji set looks like shi*.  Let's face it, most people (or at least a lot), do not like the Google ""Noto Color Emoji"" Emoji set.  If you don't believe me, then maybe you should read the comments in the following two issues on the AOSP issue tracker:  http http  And maybe you should"

Meh that whole player UI is messed up. Would be cool if someone could take advantage of it.

"Got the message. It's not pgp/mime encoded, it's a multipart/mixed message with a text/plain part that contains pgp/inline data, and an unencrypted attachment... quite the bastard of a message.  What's the background of generating such a message, if I may ask?"
"Thanks for finding a solution and going the extra step to report the bug! I had no idea how to debug that, you rock"
I'm experiencing this as well.
