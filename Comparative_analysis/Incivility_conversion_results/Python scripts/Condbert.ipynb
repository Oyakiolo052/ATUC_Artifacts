The random string used now is used a lot in other places as well (some merchants use it as Order ID, or Purchase ID, to match it with orders in their own payment systems).  Also, it is sometimes a random alpha-numeric string, sometimes only numeric. Which obfuscates it even more.  So I'd say it's good the way it is now.\n",
