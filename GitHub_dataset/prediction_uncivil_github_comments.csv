Otherwise, the bug template can be found here: https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md - No worries though

Thanks for the detailed response! Discussion like this is a good thing, no flaming necessary 😄  

1) I agree that since we maintain the environment that we can be picky about what tools we use, that being said the `ps -Aww` line exists in our `./bin/alluxio` script with which I can tell you with 99% certainty is currently used more outside of containers than inside of them. Because of that, we need to support many UNIX-like environments.
Another option would be to split the script; one for ""standard"" deployments and one for containers, but that doesn't seem like an ideal solution

2) I would argue that while many systems are not entirely compliant with UNIX standards, many of them will adhere somewhat (how close they adhere is a whole other discussion). As far as standard operating system utilities go, `ps` is a very common one and I would _expect_ that most operating systems containing this utility to support the very minimal set of arguments that are described in the standard. I don't know this for a fact, so maybe I should just do my research- but I think using the arguments specified in the standard gives us the highest probability of guaranteeing portability across a variety of UNIX-like platforms.

3) I agree, it's not the most elegant command. I wish I could come up with an elegant (and more _portable_!) solution. I don't see another way off the top of my head though.",1,0,prediction_comments_alluxio.csv

On the other hand, as you are saying there are concepts of young and mature already. The thing about all of those concepts, it's so hard to think of suitable icons for them, especially for learning. Colors are a suitable alternative, but I just hate them so much.

I do not really agree with your assesment. When I looked at the various crash we had on beta, I got the feeling that, for many of them, trying to reproduce them manually would be hard, as it would be related to accessing directly a col when we should not.
I suspect that, in many cases, cleaning the collection access and ensuring the queue works as expected would probably clean many bug that would be hard to tackle individually.

To be clear, I know there will be cases where moving from synchronous to asynchronous will be complex. I do not suggest we clean all of them.

`.git-blame-ignore-revs` is the standard for ignoring revs in a blame, it doesn't seem like there's similar functionality in `skip`, but I think I'd rather a file, as that allows us to screw up the convention a few times and recover from it, rather than relying on immutable commit messages

Anki desktop doesn't do this. But yes, a message that ""xyz.jpg"" already exists and thus was renamed to ""xyz (n).jpg"" would be a hell of a clean approach.

Or if file posting doesn't work (or just sucks for some other reason) and acra+acralyzer can handle like 1000 lines of logcat, just ""turn on debug logging"" and ""send error report""?

That's one way anyway. That's not particularly empowering though as the user can't see it themselves and one of the reason the HTML/JS debugging works well (it has in the past) for people willing to work is that it requires no coordination with anyone - it's all self-contained

Damn, I had assumed there was an API for that 😢 

Thankfully, in our specific use case, there is a very simple heuristic we can use: Show the mark/flag item in the top bar unless the corresponding menu item is set to ""always"" show.

There are two scenarios where the heuristic fails:
1) An item is set to 'if room' but is actually visible in the toolbar
2) An item is set to 'always' but is actually *not* visible in the toolbar

Failure scenario one is totally acceptable IMO as it just falls back to the current behavior. Failure scenario two is not ideal, but it should only happen in the pathological case where the user has gone and explicitly changed the preferences to set more items to 'always' than there is room for in the toolbar.

Well first of all the kind of ""obvious part"": 
In principle every new PR starts with the process:

```
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git checkout -b my-feature-branch

and ideally every time something is committed upstream between creating the feature branch and merging it, the following will also be done:

```
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git checkout -
git rebase master
```

Doing this ensures that every PR contains only ""fast forward commits"", and therefore that what is run on the CI is the exact same as the state the master branch would be in after a `git merge`. In general I only ask contributors to rebase if I think it's necessary for some reason, but in principle you should always do it.

> Earlier, you said there is no real problem if the client inserts lots of notes (because it can easily be done in Anki Desktop). Why not use the same argument here?

There I was talking about the case where the developer screws up and does something stupid. A one-time bulk delete followed by probable uninstall of the offending app is relatively easy for the user to. Building a system into the API that requires the user to regularly do bulk deletions is a completely different story.

> The problem here is you are trying to discourage updating fields, by making things awkward for the client, but I don't think that works. Since the client is updating their own notes, and they have been granted permission (by the user) to update those notes, this is something between the client and the user (not AnkiDroid). If the client writes over the user's edits, then the user complains to the client.

I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree on this particular point. I strongly believe that separating inserting and updating of notes into separate API calls is the correct way to design the API, and I don't think it's going to be that awkward.

And i guess i can get used to it.

My main reference for this kind of split is GMail, and i think they have one toolbar and make it look like two. They have a search button where the left ⋮ is in AnkiDroid, only one ⋮, and no gap. That app also hides the mini drawer in the one-pane just-one-email view in portrait mode, cf #3702.

Actually for me, it doesn't randomize the cards at all. For a deck of Japanese the new
cards would always appear according to Japanese alphabet sorting so it would show cards
that start with a, i, u, e, o after which the cards for ka, ki, ku, ke, ko are shown.
This sucks as it leads to cards with similar sounds being introducted next to each
other.

I have resolved the issue of both the question and answer being read on my phone successfully.
On the deck options there is an item that says: “When answer shown, replay both question
and answer”. I have deselected this and it makes a huge difference to my experience.

Sometimes when a deck starts it battles to find the language or read the first question.
I have found that I can live with this as a more minor irritant.

Thanks for the confirmation, and your work on an excellent program. The issue is indeed
disheartening. I was quite happy when ICS first introduced good support for complex

in my use case. But as it is, I do wish they'd solve at least *one* of the two issues!

A quick workaround is to add this to your note's CSS:
ruby { margin-top: .3em; }

We're using tables to do furigana, but we're probably better off copying what desktop
Anki does: https://github.com/dae/anki/blob/master/aqt/qt.py#L40

Tables can get ugly. I've noticed furigana is now also left-aligned in Anki 2, so this
would fix that too without a manual addition by users. Too bad we can't use ruby tags
since they aren't supported in earlier Androids.

Yeah, I was wondering too how we will do the merging if we can't fit the whole JSONObject
in memory...

Any idea how big it was? A radical solution would be to have a cut-off limit on that
JSONObject that if we exceed, we abort the sync and re-initiate it with the full-sync-required
mode. But it's ugly and risky.

I tried to dump the database and use it to recreate a new anki deck as suggested in
your link.  It did not work.

Yes, I do copy the deck using dropbox between my phone and my computer.  I am always
very careful never to have a deck open in two places at once, although it may be possible
that I did something to screw it up.  When it got corrupted, it was at the end of a
relatively long review session on my phone, and there was no copying involved at that
particular time.  I'm not sure what to think.  I may backup to a version from before
the first corruption.

Can we get a real solution to this problem within AnkiDroid's code? Nested folders as
suggested by #13 would be perfect. Media zips as suggested by Damien would be ideal
for transfer speeds.

After updating to JB, I can't mount NTFS or EXT3/4 anymore. Which really sucks as I
hit the file count limit way too easily. Managing which media files I need for the
week is nearly impossible.

Since it seems like NTFS is no go for me unless I jump back to ICS, is there any good
workarounds for this? Like a script to sort out all the media on cards that will be
due within the next week, and/or a script to rename all the media to shorter filenames?

Same Issue with my Samsungs Galaxy Tablet 2-7.0 (GT-P3100)+(Adrd 4.0.4) since one or
two days. No matter which app, browser or text-field - nothing is pasted anymore. Some
apps also crash while I try to paste something (Chrome especially). It appeared to
me, that c/p-function was already somehow bitchy since weeks.

Regarding several other forums, it seems like a factory-reset is not solving the bug,
it returns after a few weeks. 

So, looks like a major bug. Who knows how to get rid of it?

Thanks for your research Bardo :-)

Most of the developers don't have e-ink devices and are thus more motivated to work
on other things, but good news: AnkiDroid is open source!
You seem very motivated and could become a great force in AnkiDroid, just install the
Android SDK, learn Java, and you can make it happen :-)
Java programming is not really difficult, just be prepared to spend a few days studying
patiently AnkiDroid's code and Aardict's code. We are ready to help you if you have
any question.

Here is how to get started in less than a day:
https://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/wiki/Contribution#Source_code

In parallel, could you please investigate what is the purpose of each of the methods
in the class below? This class has zero documentation, having it documented would probably
help a lot.

Ah damn, I got excited when I read comment 8 saying ""it"" was fixed.

Unfortunately Geoff's workaround above doesn't work when ""Hide question in answer""
is defined by the card model, so it's necessary to have it set for all decks.

I guess I'll just sit patiently and wait for full Anki 2 support.

You're right, it is due to the TTS play button - it screws up the last closing HTML
tag on your cards. 

It was annoying me too so I've fixed it,  I'll submit a fix as soon as I figure out
the process in github. 

For now, a workaround might be to add some extra characters at the end of your card
- try adding 3 spaces after your closing </span>.

Actually I just saw the real reason why this happens now but not before.

The DECK_VERSION was still at 64, so every time we opened a deck it would go again
in upgradeDeck (although won't do anything, except the last bit with the pageSize),
grrr so stupid.

<Nicolas_Raoul> so is #216 not a bug?
<dae> the problem is the desktop has only one text editing format - HTML
<dae> but HTML is not easily understandable for end users so it sets the webview to
treat newlines as <br> too
<dae> but this causes issues with more complicated html, and it is better fixed by
giving a selectable wysiwyg & html view
<dae> and removing the newline magic
<Nicolas_Raoul> so a solution could be to use a wysiwyg editor component instead of
the text input component... if that exists
<dae> except qt's sucks
<dae> it needs to be done with editable divs in the latest webkit, but anki is stuck
on older qt verions on osx due to serious bugs in later releases

Ok I tested it, and it works great now that the times are the same. I'm really impressed
with the new version!

This is what I think happened: My phone's time was a couple of minutes behind my computer's
time and I went straight from looking at the count on my desktop to syncing the deck
with AnkiDroid and looking at the count on the phone. I'm guessing a couple of reviews
that had become due on my desktop had not become due yet on AnkiDroid due to the time
difference. However, like I said above, by doing some reviews on AnkiDroid while it
was ""behind"" my desktop time, and then syncing it with the server, and then syncing
my desktop Anki deck, I *think* I was able to screw up the counters so that the clients
thought they were synced but were displaying different values. That's just a guess
though, but I was definitely able to have different counts in AnkiDroid and Anki even
though they said they were synced...

I've also noticed the slow load of the deck, I'll look at it in detail after I'm done
with the answer delay.

In light of how hard I find it to speed up the writes to the DB, I think it's worth
checking what exactly happens during the deck optimization and see if we can do the
same, or part of it in the Android version, so that the degradation of performance
happens slower. But for now I'm optimizing...

Minor update: I did try to consolidate the aforementioned steps 1 & 2 into one update
statement (an ugly one) and I believe it is slightly faster. I'm not 100% sure because
the speedup is probably about 600ms, when the timings are wildly varying between 5000ms
and 6300ms from answer to answer. It's hard to estimate the average and then the speedup.

In any case, regarding the optimization of steps 1 and 2, I think I've hit the ceiling
(or rather the floor) and that's around 0.6 seconds faster.

Moving on to steps 3 and 4...

This is exactly why many people hate open-source. While I love it and appreciate it,
having an enhancement request open for FOUR YEARS is just sick, given that it is one
stupid setting.
Instead of adding new nifty superficial 'enhancements' nobody uses, you should implement
something as important as this. While shifting responsibility to someone else is very
comfy, it also makes you look rather bleak in your determination for a good product
everyone could use.

This feature is just attach sounds to the cards and it could be used for whatever you
want. For example, I use it a lot on my English deck, to get used to hear the right
pronunciation of unknown words in the card (English pronunciation is damn diffictult

to download the last version of the code from GitHub.

This is using alpha 10.
What would be a path to normality? start again with 4.2, ignoring the hash-named deck,

It looks fine other than the following issues which will need to be resolved:
1. ic_menu_refresh needs to be changed to the sync one with the two arrows

3. the color of the icons doesn't gel with the rest of the Holo interface. If possible please write your script so that it generates and copies all the icons, and temporarily set it to render them using the [holo theme colors](http://developer.android.com/design/style/iconography.html#action-bar). Put the script in the tools folder and configure it so that it can be run from the main parent folder with an optional argument for the location of the cloned github repository. e.g. `./tools/render-icons.sh $HOME/material-design-icons`. That way, once the targetApi is updated to 21, we can just change the color settings in the script and be on our way. In cases where the name of the icon in the source is different from the old filename, you should modify the xml to use the new filename, and delete the old file rather than trying to maintain consistency.

56402,"cool =) year long ops always suck

As a matter of fact, while on the topic, it takes so freaking long to list
all cards, it really should be improved. As you know, it currently blocks
the whole ui and the user can't user what's listed so far until it's done.
It would be much more usable if the list could be used while it was
loading. Otherwise, I'll never use that whole list.

I can also reproduce it coming from the deck picker on 2.1; it seems that 3 tasks are lined up simultaneously because of a `saveCollection()` call when exiting the DeckPicker, which causes the render to be cancelled.

Anyway, I implemented your fix and [submitted a bug report to the main Android issue tracker](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=68271), but I'm afraid this non-thread-safe behavior in Android 4.4 is going to cause a bit of shit-storm in Android 4.4.

I'll defer to @meteorcloudy as to whether that is workable; `//external` is currently used for querying repository rules and replacing it with an ugly string would make that use case much uglier (`bazel query //__bazel-external__:$REPO` instead of `bazel query //external:repo`). It is also used with `bind()` rules, which are themselves deprecated but not removed.

@meteorcloudy has been working on `bazel modquery` which I hope will replace `bazel query //external:` but then getting rid of  `//external:` has the dependency of removing the legacy WORKSPACE file, which won't happen in at least a year, probably two.

@meteorcloudy : will `modquery` replace all the use cases of `bazel query //external:`?

I could imagine adding that flag to rename `//external:` to tide you over in the meantime, but only if we are confident that `modquery` is the future; otherwise, it would stay as yet another ""forever incompatible flag"" that fragments the Bazel ecosystem . I'm not too worried about `query //external:`, but I am worried about `bind()` because its use requires the string `//external:` in BUILD files which would be invalidated by the proposed rename.

The best options I can think of ATM are to write a custom rule and declare the output as a directory using `ctx.actions.declare_directory`, write a linter rule enforcing 1 struct per file with a matching name (which many devs are opposed to when there are several small dependent structs that aren't meant to be used separately) or as mentioned, write a custom build script that generates BUILD code, which is rather an ugly hack IMO and invites someone to build a meta-build system by creating space 'above' bazel.",1,1,prediction_comments_bazel.csv

- we want binding names to be the same across all three bzl environments (BUILD-loaded, WORKSPACE-loaded, and Bzlmod-loaded)

- we don't necessarily want the same binding name to point to the same object (enforcing this tends to cause an `if` at the top of the bound function anyway)
- we don't want to enforce identical fields under the `native` object for the three bzl environments (so using `native.cc_library` in a WORKSPACE-loaded bzl file should simply result in a ""field not found"" error)

Yes, suspending Java stack frames requires hanging on to an OS thread without Loom, but I think even that's fine because:
1. We don't (usually) have that many repository downloads going on in parallel
2. We are pretty liberal with creating new OS threads anyway and if all they do is wait for some blocking network operation to finish, they aren't a huge cost
3. Loom is around the corner anyways

Even better, my understanding is that if this is implemented with the naive ""put a native `Thread` in a `SkyKeyComputeState`"" approach, converting it to Loom is pretty cheap because Loom ""coroutines"" are basically Java Threads.

When you don't enable Bzlmod, `@platforms` for everyone is the `@@platforms` repo defined in a WORKSPACE prefix/suffix (don't remember which). All good.

When you enable Bzlmod, `@platforms` is still the `@@platforms` repo defined in a WORKSPACE prefix/suffix for everything that is *not* in the Bzlmod system (i.e. all the WORKSPACE repos including `@@rules_nodejs`). However, for things in the Bzlmod system (i.e. only built-in modules like `bazel_tools` and `local_config_platform` because your MODULE.bazel file is empty), `@platforms` actually refers to `@@platforms~0.0.5`. This is important because when we search for an appropriate execution platform (most likely your host machine), `@local_config_platform//:host` actually uses the platforms defined in `@@platforms~0.0.5`, but `rules_nodejs` defines toolchains for platforms defined in `@@platforms`.

The best solution I have found (which seems to work _ok_, but isn't ideal) is to define an `default_config_alias` rule that passes through all providers from the aliased rule, and has _both_ and incoming _and_ outgoing edge transition attached to it. For every config option that is configured anywhere in our build by native or Starlark transitions, the incoming edge transition sets it to some garbage value and the outgoing edge transition sets it back to a sane ""global"" default value. This ensures that _one_ of those transitions will definitely add it to the `affected by starlark transition` list.

This is ugly for a few reasons:
1. Because it requires two transitions, we can't attach this to the actual rule we want to protect, which means we need to mark that rule as ""manual"" so it doesn't build directly.
2. (like with `output directory name`) dependencies of the protected rule are ""marred"" by the transition, and can't share configuration with any other instances of themselves. In this case, it's because the `affected by starlark transition` list has grown and there's no way to shrink it again. This means some tools (and their dependencies) get built twice.

@gregestren / @sdtwigg I _think_ the ideal solution here is to define `affected by starlark transition` as only containing config settings whose values do not match _their original value_ as configured on the command line, so that a starlark transition can ""reset"" the effects of a previous transition, and restore the configuration to a canonical state in the process. I don't know how hard that is to implement.

As a (maybe) simpler fallback, just allowing a transition to directly specify `affected by starlark transition` and not overruling it immediately would let us ""promise"" we've undone all previous transitions, although it requires trusting the transition author more. This looks like it should be only a couple lines of change in Bazel.",1,0,prediction_comments_bazel.csv
21915,"> That standard configuration ends up with an output root of `nocpu-fastbuild-STxxxxx/` (our ""standard"" configuration defines ""nocpu"" architecture), but since it's always exactly the same configuration the hash is always identical, and it doesn't cause rebuilds.

OK. Does this mean you transition `//command_line_option:compilation_mode` to `fastbuild` also?
We have a separate patch to be able to do transitions on that, I'm unsure if you can do this on master.

> I keep on seeing themes of you, @eric-skydio and others basically reinventing the output path algorithm with horrible hacks. This makes me further think we should settle on a principled core algorithm and do that.

Sounds good. Be aware that these ""horrible hacks"" can include domain/implementation specific components. If we have for instance a build setting affecting only D below, we might want to include that in the output path in D only to avoid duplicated actions in A, B, C, E.
```
A -> B -> E
A -> C -> D -> E

The issue I'm thinking of is rules that generate several actions with different configuration dependencies (like generate + compile). There is a cost associated with splitting these rules to several rules and cluttering the target graph.

> What else would you want from the IDE perspective?

Without having the whole picture, I guess one common use case is to be able to configure ""find coverage files in this directory"" or ""find generated sources in this directory"" in a way that hopefully survives a few rebases. A separate build setting for this use-case may be acceptable.",1,1,prediction_comments_bazel.csv
21988,"The reason why Bazel doesn't have this admittedly basic piece of functionality is that it's, surprisingly, not doable with the data Bazel keeps about an action.

Since some actions have a lot of inputs, Bazel doesn't store the checksums of each input or even the set of inputs for each cached action (except for C++). Instead, what it does it stores just the xor of all the checksums of all `<input path, checksum of input file>` pairs (see `MetadataDigestUtils.fromMetadata()`. This is so that the action cache uses less RAM.

So when one of these files changes, it's detected, but Bazel cannot tell which one changed (hell, I don't even know how we detect when the set of inputs files changed...)

In order to fix this, we could do two things:
1. Peek into Skyframe invalidation (that wouldn't work on Bazel server restarts, but it would work most of the time and it would be complicated)
2. Replace the action cache (it's looking increasingly like a tempting target for multiple reasons, but it's not a small amount of work and it has to fulfill some pretty strict CPU and RAM constraints)
3. Accept the increase in memory use by the action cache and store the whole input path -> checksum map with it. My guess is that the additional memory use would not be acceptable, but maybe it will be if we reuse paths just right?

This warning messages happen when all the source files of a `proto_library` in an external repository are generated and therefore `--proto_path=<root of external repository>` is superfluous. However, the list of proto source roots comes from the same place that we use to determine the prefix we should cut off the exec path to obtain the proto import path.

Of course, we have to cut off different parts depending on whether the proto file is source or generated, but that we determine by... guesswork in `guessProtoPathUnderRoot`:

https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/proto/ProtoCompileActionBuilder.java#L659

That algorithm broke when we removed the directory from the set of proto paths. The reason why only Go broke is that this line trying to cater for legacy use cases saves us, but I don't want to rely on it:

https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/proto/ProtoCompileActionBuilder.java#L671

, but `go_proto_library` sensibly doesn't have its equivalent.

So that change was indeed wrong. Now, the question is, how to make it right -- eliminating the warning requires that we remove a repository root from the set of proto paths if there are only generated files, but if we remove it, the algorithm to generate `-I` clauses suddenly stops working.

Furthermore, it's not trivial to decouple `--proto_path` from `-I` because they are both derived from `ProtoInfo`, which is exposed to Starlark, so we can't just change it willy-nilly. In particular, it only has room for one direct proto source root, which is not enough: the principled fix is to make it so that `ProtoInfo.proto_source_root` is an execpath and not a root-relative path and if a `proto_library` has both generated and source `.proto` files, one would require both.

A saving grace is that `ProtoInfo` cannot currently be created from Starlark, so we may get away with adding a Java field that's not exposed to Starlark and leaving `ProtoInfo.proto_source_root` as a polite lie.

However, it's far from a trivial change :(",1,1,prediction_comments_bazel.csv
41415,"So, I got a bit nerd sniped and I have another solution: simply create a virtual proto import directory when the `proto_library` rule has a generated `.proto` file just like we do when `strip_import_prefix` or `import_prefix` is set.

Granted, it's not _that_ simple because we still need to make sure that our internal repository keeps chugging along, but I'd gladly fork the behavior of `proto_library` in this respect (they are different already, so no big change) if that's what I have to do to make `proto_library` saner for everyone else.

That's _still_ not a tiny amount of work and it is _still_ possible that some odd downstream project breaks, but this is certainly much simpler than the previous alternative. And it doesn't even require lying to Starlark!",1,1,prediction_comments_bazel.csv

I guess this only affects developers working on JGit-Gerrit, basically. And if older Bazel versions are not affected, this is not a big deal, I think?

46580,"I completely misunderstood this proposal on first read -- I thought you wanted to remove package() entirely!

You're saying to keep `package()` allowed in BUILD files, but remove the `native.package()` spelling within .bzl files, the rationale being that `package()` declarations should syntactically appear in the BUILD file they affect.

If all we do is remove `native.package()`, then .bzl files could theoretically still access the `package()` function if it is passed in to a macro:

    # BUILD file
    load("":my_logic.bzl"", ""my_special_header"")
    my_special_header(package)
    ...

    # my_logic.bzl
    def my_special_header(package_func):
        package_func(...)

The simplest thing to do is allow but discourage this monstrosity. Alternatively, we could give `package()` the magical ability to inspect the stack and fail if it is not called from within a BUILD file.",1,1,prediction_comments_bazel.csv
46773,"Update:

I found a fix. Insert the following to ```./scripts/generate_bash_completion.sh```:

```javabase=/sasdata/ra/user/john.doe/.loca/brew/opt/jdk```

where that path is in fact just ```JAVA_HOME```. This is certainly an ugly hack. If I am correct, setting ```--host_javabase``` and/or ```--javabase``` should achieve the same effect. However, I have no luck thus far. I tried to add the following to ```./BUILD```:

```
java_runtime(
    name =  ""jdk_local"",
    java_home = ""/sasdata/ra/user/john.doe/.loca/brew/opt/jdk"",
    visibility = [""//visibility:public""]
)
```

and set ```--javabase=:jdk_local```.

But then I encounter the same ```glibc``` error. It seems to me that the ```--javabase``` flag somehow did not propogate to the ```javabase``` variable in ```./scripts/generate_bash_completion.sh```. What did I do wrong here?

I was building bazel from source, and nowhere in the docs (under either _using_ nor _installing_) does it say that on Windows the `bazelrc` file is required.

Thanks for changing the exception to ""IllegalState"", though. That's far less misleading than before.

But it still doesn't help someone trying to use or build bazel for the first time.

On my system, I tried **both** the prebuilt binary and building from source.

Reading the comments in this bug report, it wasn't (and still isn't) clear that a `bazelrc` is needed _even for bootstrap-building_ bazel.

In this case, the code fell back to `cygdrive` which _should have worked_ but didn't because my slow crapware-riddled corporate laptop cannot have the JVM launch an external process in less than three seconds.

Build performance.

A few notes -
1. The PR doesn't fix the problem, of course. It might actually break others, whose AutoValue is of an older version. Nevertheless, I'll approve it, because Bazel has itself to gain from a bumped version (specifically, the CopyAnnotation which I added, allows for AutoValue-ed classes to be exposed to Skylark).
2. @kush-c is looking into loading the runner classes in a separate class-loader, which might solve the problem. In the meanwhile, we can (a) stop depending on AutoValue in the TestRunner or (b) try to move the TestRunner_deploy.jar to the end of the classpath. I have a vague feeling that Java pick the first class it finds. (b) could solve all such collisions, if it works.

It could be argued that one should use a `genrule` or something to merge the static libraries and then include the resultant thing in `srcs`. But this solution comes with a caveat:
- In an environment where multiple platforms and multiple toolchains (including cross-compiling ones) exist, writing a correct `genrule` to merge archives is **hard**.

This living outside of bazel means my CI setup is more complex than it needs to be (I need a build for each release, since I can't rely on ci.sh just doing the right thing.) Also it's slow as crap due to #370.

I'm not sure what would make the most sense for this, but I'm imagining something like this:

```
ios_framework(

  # things to leave out of the framework lib.

- add our own Cache Control Header
- activate gzip (thats really helpful!)

mount -t tmpfs -o size=200M none /var/lib/nginx/cache

To do this, the way events are recorded have to be changed. Some events
(e.g. whiteboard) depends on previous events. So it the start draw events
are not recording while the draw updates and stop events are recorded,
changes have to be made on the record processing to handle this.

I have a question about GDPR. I'm not familiar with it. How about logs? The
logs contain personal information? Should we turn that off too? Same thing
for analytics data (users in the meeting, etc.) Is it all or nothing? That
is, what if others are ok for data to be collected while a few are not? How
do we handle that? Or how do others do it?

Thanks.

2202,"I've just spent several hours banging my head against the wall trying to get BBB behind NAT working, without much success — until I stumbled across this issue. I do not use a dummy network interface as I've configured my firewall to redirect traffic from BBB's internal IP to BBB's external IP back to its internal IP, meaning that part of the communication works just fine — but then the ACL thingy this issue describes rears its ugly head. It's very, very obscure.

Therefore I'm begging you, include this information in the official documentation.

To summary, the following works:

* BBB 2.5 behind NAT
* no dummy network interface
* router/firewall configured to forward all relevant ports from external to BBB
* router/firewall configured to forward TCP from BBB's internal IP to its external IP back to its internal IP & SNAT that to the firewall's internal IP
* FreeSWITCH, MediaSoup configured as listed on BBB's ""behind NAT"" document
* additionally set `<param name=""local-network-acl"" value=""none""/>` as described in this issue

2331,"> Apart from that, it can still be a static option

There are static, configurable codec options. I even implemented a floating/flexible codec configuration (see [this](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-webrtc-sfu/blob/master/config/default.example.yml#L116-L117), value `ANY`), which is a  pretty darn clever thingy.

So this is not about configuration. We're talking about adding VP9 support to KMS (which involves either backporting upstream gstreamer VP9 parsers, payloaders and depayloaders and bolting them in OR implementing those ourselves). KMS does not handle VP9 right now. Substantial amount of work to get it up. More work to get it rock solid.

About the renegotiation stuff: yeah, sure, we could worry about that after we do support VP9 in our media server and if we want a fully flexible codec mismatch handling.

I'll paste what I said before:

> We're aware of the advantages VP9 provides. It's just a question of priorities right now.

For the record, Mconf has been contributing to BigBlueButton for over 9 years now!  They have made HUGE contributions to the quality and features of the project, with contributions stretching back to the early Flash days to the kick-ass HTML5 client we now enjoy.

Everyone using BigBlueButton today has directly benefited from Mconf's work.  I believe it's important that Mconf be recognized for their open source contribution and respected for their decisions to build additional value in their commercial hosting.  

You can see the core developers listed [here](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/support/faq.html#bigbluebutton-committer), many of which are employed by Mconf.  Mconf has held no less than six developer summits at their offices over the years, as shown [here](https://bigbluebutton.org/2020/01/09/15th-developer-summit/), [here](https://bigbluebutton.org/2017/10/15/bigbluebutton-developer-summit-xi/), [here](https://bigbluebutton.org/2016/12/30/bigbluebutton-developer-summit-ix/), [here](https://bigbluebutton.org/2015/11/26/bigbluebutton-summit-vii-porto-alegre-brazil/), [here](https://bigbluebutton.org/2014/12/03/developer-summit-v-porto-alegre-brazil/), and [here](https://bigbluebutton.org/2013/10/30/bigbluebutton-summit-iii-porto-alegre-brazil/).

It's really important to the health of the BigBlueButton ecosystem that commercial companies can thrive as they both contribute to the project and strengthen their commercial offerings.

Mconf is a great example of a company doing both.  If you want to support the project and you think Mconf can help you with hosting or support for BigBlueButton, [contact them](https://mconf.com/).

You see, I've tested every possible scenario (well, not every! but a lot), and the result was that there's no other way to transmit audio, other than using our own microphone, which is really awful.

To be precise, I've also used a tool called [VB-CABLE Virtual Audio Device](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/) for windows and other similar solutions for Mac or Linux, and none of them works.

I've been using discord too. Discord used to have the ability to screen share your browser AND you could transmit your device's audio directly while you screen share, no matter what your browser or OS was.
You can see the relevant settings in the part where it's titled **SOUND HOOK/SOUND SHARE**: https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000982752-Screen-sharing-Video-Calls

I strongly recommend to mention Acoustic Echo Cancellation in the wiki or the docs.
Reason: Echo AVOIDING is always better than Echo Cancellation. No matter how good the
algorithm in Flash might be it cannot beat a session, where there is no acoustic echo
in the first place. Like when everybody is on headsets.
The often used practice ""everybody not talking mutes his mic"" is helpful but can generate
some nasty audio artifacts when a mic is unmuted. I am more than happy to explain why,
but think most people are interested in these kinds of details! ;-) 

P.S. Its called ACOUSTIC Echo Cancellation and not AUTOMATIC.

Hi Hedgehog,

We're not familiar with Adhersion, but we're thinking along the lines of experimenting
launching an external SiP client via a URL (see: http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.html#sec-19.1.6).

The browser initially wouldn't recognize the MIME type, but if the user associated
it with their SIP client, we could prototype providing all the information needed in
the SIP URL for the client to connect.

A use case scenario would be:

  1.  Join the BigBlueButton session through their browser.

      In the chat window is a link that reads User clicks SIP URL in the chat window

          Welcome to this BigBlueButton demo server.  This server is running 0.71a.

          For help see _tutorial videos_.

          To join the voice conference:
              (1) click the headset icon in the upper-left, or
              (2) dial 613-366-1985 and enter conference ID: 74665.
              (3) Click _Launch SIP Client_

  2.  The user clicks _Launch SIP Client_


The SIP client launches and they are communicating directly with asterisk or FreeSWITCH.


Of course, the downside of the above is that the user's would need to have a separate
SIP client installed, but with a bit of support, there could be scenarios where a teacher
would used a SIP client to connect, whereas the students would stay with the built-in
VoIP.

I can't imagine that aping the ""crypto"" wording of shitcoin casinos is going to help much with usability...but it will certainly tarnish the brand and turn away its core bitcoin-focused demographic. 

Bisq 1 is a bitcoin-only exchange however you word it. The only difference is in how you pay for it.

If the goal is to make Bisq's most active trading pairs more clear, I suggest doing it more subtly:
- ordering currencies in the currency dropdown by activity instead of alphabetically
- changing ""Filter by currency"" text to ""Buy BTC with..."" for buy screen and ""Sell BTC with..."" for sell screen
- changing ""Filter by payment method"" text to ""Using these payment methods...""",1,1,prediction_comments_bisq.csv

It seems the core reason for this proposal in the first place is to address XMR users who don't know Bisq trades XMR...this strikes me as a flimsy premise to begin with since Bisq is routinely mentioned in XMR circles, events, etc.

487,"I agree that Bisq should make buying BSQ simple. 

I think it is easy to buy BSQ once you know what to do but it does take a little time to figure out. This could be made easier. There is a wiki that has been made that is helpful: https://bisq.wiki/Buy_BSQ

I think it would be good to take into consideration how to onboard new users to Bisq in the client on the [new UI design](https://github.com/bisq-network/projects/issues/47).


> After digging into ""Account -> Altcoin Accounts"" and past all the shitcoins, manage to get ""BSQ"" buried amongst the masses [Star it at top?].

Yes, I agree BSQ should be given prominence.

> Not entirely clear the effects of ""trade instant (within 1 hour with this altcoin effects)"" being selected changes. No ""(i)"" with further info. No link to wiki.

Agree, there is some mention here: https://bisq.wiki/Payment_methods#Altcoin_payment_methods but it could be expanded. 

> BSQ address - must enter this... how? 

I agree with the suggestion of auto generating an address if this is possible.

I am also aware that the BSQ address someone enters when creating there account will then be used for all their BSQ trades. I think this is not best practice. Changing the address every trade is not possible if you have multiple offers, and even impractical if you do one at a time. It would be good to know if this is something that can be changed. It might be I am not doing it correctly though!

> The BTC to BSQ is rather confusing initially, in that requires a conversion still to some fiat to get a grasp of what is being traded. No sats standard yet.

Yes, it is a little confusing but I think for altcoins comparing to a price in BTC is the standard. I look at the DAO dashboard to get an idea of the price in BSQ in dollars. There was discussion about including other prices, EUR was suggested, but this was discounted. I think USD comparisons are the standard.

> No clear indication of what explorer and how to validate if funds have been sent.

Agreed, I think a wiki would be useful. I have just learnt a little as I have gone along. Recently I noticed when clicking on BSQ transactions IDs it was opening up a BTC explorer. I know BSQ is fundamentally BTC but think that the BSQ explorers should be standard. It could have been me changing the setting to use the wrong explorer I suppose.

I had investigated a similar issue of @MwithM. There have been 3 times a deposit tx not being stored in the wallet but at the time it was created all looked ok. The trades completed as well. But later as the spending (deposit) tx seems to have been lost (not sure yet as its 3 weeks ago and the user did some spv resyns in between) the outputs from the trade fee tx was considered unspent in Bisq, even it was spent. A restore from seed cleaned all up and balance was also confirmed with importing the seeds in electrum (one need to make 2 wallets there, one for legacy and one for segwit - and BSQ has to be considered as well). 

I highly recommend to NOT use Electrum for sending out funds (for cross checking the balance its ok) as specially with BSQ things can go very wrong (BSQ burned) and if Bisq app is still in use Bisq data can get screwed up. Also getting out funds vai Bisq always works (at least I have not seen any case so far where it did not work - and if there are cases we need to find out the reason to fix it).",1,1,prediction_comments_bisq.csv

6256,"I spent a lot of time in Feb 2020 profiling Bisq's RAM usage on Linux (Ubuntu), followed by some conclusions detailed [here](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/3918#issuecomment-594236960).

Long story short, I found three types of problems, but no perfect solutions yet.

1.   Uncontrollable off heap memory use by Java / JavaFX based app.
Any Java/JFX based UI is a greedy beast, and if you don't configure the jvm's maximum RAM limit -- how much the jvm 'thinks' it has --  it may bring your machine to a halt as it tries to use more ram than your machine actually has.  This is not a generalization about all Java UIs, but does seem to be generally true for JavaFX on Linux, regardless of whether you use mesa or gpu drivers.  On the other hand, reducing your JVMs max ram limit too much risks an earlier Java app OOME than would normally happen.  This leaves me with having to choose between two options: which do I want to see run out of memory first, my Bisq instance or my computer?  
To control Bisq's off heap memory use, we decided to start Bisq on Linux and OSX with this jvm option:  `-XX:MaxRAM=4g""`.  That means Bisq's JVM normally uses about 25% of the maximum RAM limit, or about 1 Gb.  The upside is Bisq users' computers are not liable to crash because of Bisq, but it increases the risk Bisq may run out of memory, and throw an `OutOfMemoryException`.
See the **Setting JVM's MaxRAM** section of this comment for a few details.  



2.  A long chain sync at startup locks up the UI thread until it's done, gobbles off heap memory, and doesn't give it back to the OS.
This is unavoidable (so far).  I work around it like so: wait a few minutes (don't touch the UI) while my Bisq installation finishes the chain download (check log), then shut down and restart Bisq. The UI will become responsive more quickly after the restart.  

3.  There are numerous and serious memory leak problems in JFX 11, and Bisq is stuck with it until we can upgrade it with the migration to JDK 15 (in progress).   See the section below about **JavaFX Memory Leaks** .  



**Setting JVM's MaxRAM**

My OpenJDK 11 JVM is configured with a default MaxRAM setting of 128 Gb, while my machine has only 32 Gb.

To check yours...

```
java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version | grep MaxRAM
 uint64_t MaxRAM                                   = 137438953472                           {pd product} {default}
    uintx MaxRAMFraction                           = 4                                         {product} {default}
   double MaxRAMPercentage                         = 25.000000                                 {product} {default}

```   


I show how adjusting (lowering) the jvm's `MaxRAM` can affect memory usage [here](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/3918#issuecomment-594236960). 

Today, the bisq-desktop startup script sets this value to 4Gb by including the setting on the java command:  `DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS=""-XX:MaxRAM=4g""`

**JavaFX Memory Leaks**


One of the major sources of these problems is the JFX 11 dependency.  The upgrade to JDK 15 will allow us to also upgrade Bisq's JFX dependency, which I do hope will not be as leaky.  The newer JFX will have many leak related bug fixes -- and hopefully not too many new leak related bugs.

Pasted from an [earlier comment](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/4048#issuecomment-625445260) on the subject.

> > Btw, this means Bisq (or any JavaFX app) could behave differently on different systems, depending on that system's video settings (graphic card hardware? graphics drivers? amount of shared RAM between video and system? etc -- don't know what could play a role, but smth to keep in mind when looking at performance).
> 
> JavaFX does behave differently with different GPUs. It does use native GPU drivers, and there have been many leak problems in JFX related to GPU and mesa drivers.
> 
> Here is a list of some [jfx leak related issues](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8115293?jql=project%20%3D%20JDK%20AND%20component%20%3D%20javafx%20AND%20text%20~%20%22leak%22) -- old and new. You have to hunt around for those related to GPUs, and for issues about leak related bugs found and fixed after JFX 11 was released.
> 
> Issue [8188094](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8188094) shows how to make JFX leak from a simple app running on Linux. The unresolved issue reports the problem in JDK/JFX 8/9, and I reproduced it running JFX 11 on Ubuntu + NVIDIA GPU in Feb. 2020, when I started working on this problem.
> 
> JFX 14 has some leak bugfixes, but Bisq is holding back on upgrading to OpenJDK 14 until the new [java packaging tool](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/343) is released from incubation to GA.
> 
> I did a lot of profiling to find the leaks (maybe you saw some of my comments in issue [3918](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/3918)) using JMC/JFR, JProfiler, async-profiler, bcc and bpftrace tools, under the assumption the problem was/is in Bisq and JFX. I'm sure there are leaks to find and fix, but the only firm conclusion my analysis supported was that Bisq's JVM was reserving far more resident and virtual memory at startup than the Linux JVM needs. (I could not find problems with Bisq's on-heap management.) The problem was more serious when it starts with an empty data dir, syncs the entire chain, and the JVM never gives back any memory (to the OS).

**Well, that sucks.**

Yes, it does.  If anyone can advise on how solve these difficult problems, do tell!  I would get right to work, but moving off Java is not an option in the near or medium term.  I'm not going to spend time here defending or bashing Java because I'm more worried about my nice, fast GPU's  native GPU driver that crashes my machine at random times, sometimes right after clicking a browser tab.",1,0,prediction_comments_bisq.csv
6379,">  I noticed the number of buyers claiming they are unable to pay the seller increases whenever the price of bitcoin goes down suddenly, what an amazing coincidence, right?

It would be a nice feature to see the price difference from the take offer time to the open dispute time. That would help the mediators to determine the chance that it was a future trade or not. Also with altcoins I think there are nearly no reasons that the payment could not be done (no fucking banks included). As with fiat the mediator can request page signed docs of the bank statement (failed attempted transfer). Incorrect sellers data should be easier to proof (seller can proof previous trades or pagesigned doc with dank details). Just to request page-signed doc can add enough pressure that lying becomes less frequent. But sure at the end with fiat there is always some uncertainty and to punish innocent traders hurts.

@burningman2 Thanks - what you describe above is exactly what I implemented.  Having tried it I think it is inflexible and would not be used because users think they are losing a lot of money and can get a better deal from mediation.

My current thoughts:
For users to resolve the trade between themselves, allow them to negotiate, sign/publish their 2 of 2 payout transaction using amounts that they agree upon.  Could be implemented by adding functionality to the trader chat GUI.  Should I open a DAO proposal for that @wiz ?

Interesting concept, but I think it adds complexity and might actually make it easier to match such a payment description to Bisq.

The random string used now is used a lot in other places as well (some merchants use it as Order ID, or Purchase ID, to match it with orders in their own payment systems).

Edit: To be honest, the `(b ?: 0f) > 5 -> 2` line took me a bit more than expected but I love Kotlin for its strictness. `0` is of type `Int` while `0f` is of the (correct) type `Float`. While Java allows me to check `if (b > 5)` and throws if b is `null`, Kotlin doesn't allow this but if I am fine with the NPE, I can (instead of declaring `b: Float`) test for `b!! > 5`.",1,1,prediction_comments_bisq.csv

That's a huge problem. Mediation is *the* solution. If mediation isn't working, then the system is broken. Mediators should be responsible for dealing with chargebacks like that, since dealing with a chargeback is basically the definition of mediation. Plus, a mediator would deal with it from time to time and know how to do it efficiently. Individual users who get screwed almost certainly don't know how to efficiently deal with chargebacks like that.

If you convert Bisq to a custodial exchange you get that, but then you can use Coinbase as well as you lose all what makes Bisq different. KYC will be mandatory then.

Chargeback is only  a big problem with those crappy ""friends and family"" payment methods like Paypal, Venmo and Cashapp where you just call customer care to reverse the payment. With normal banks that is not possible (you can do it maybe once but if repeated yor bank we start to ask questions, most banks require an evidence for reason).

EUR account and I am curious if I would be even legal and make any sense for them to have multiple customers share same IBAN but I after a quick search I could not find anything that clearly states that IBANS are unique.

I actually want to test it but I currently can not add my own other banks IBAN to Revolut as the app stays stuck after I enter the confirmation code or gives me a error message. This may have to do with the fact that I am using a custom AOSP based rom on my phone and there are no google play services but it worked b4 on a older version and now even downgrading the app wont work. I just spend hours trying to get this fucking app running in a emulator and same issue on top of it there seems to be a specialized build of the up to date version that my phone is downloading through the aurora store but on the emulator it only shows a outdated version.

Anyway I can't test it now with my own other SEPA account, not sure why it does not let me add my own bank as a recipient but as I said it worked fine b4 when I send money to people on Localbitcoins.

Also how am I supposed to prove to you that I can send money with my IBAN? So you want me to reveal my ID to you? You want to give me a account I send a test amount to?

Interesting side-node. My other bank changed their online banking system recently and the modernized one does not let me enter the BIC at all and forces auto detected values on me. But upon entering my GB... Revolut IBAN it detects the BIC just fine so would be curious how many people actually still have or have this issue of wrong BIC numbers. I saw a issue about that and it sounded like that was the reason for disabling it. But again I am just asking for you to enabled sending not receiving. I did not send anything but I think its save to assume that sending to it in my case works perfectly as it should and so does it with PayPal and CC.

One thing is for sure Revolut sucks big time, website accounting is artificially restricted so we fools get their stupid app that has **8 trackers in it**. Only business customers get a web-interface ... why would I want to carry my banking with me on a stupid spy device? Makes no sense to me.

I do not understand how this relates to cc fraudsters. What the difference if they can cache out BTC with revolut to revolut transfers as opposed to caching out BTC with SEPA to SEPA transfers?

Feedback from this experience indicate the following:

- there is no need to specify receiver's city, just country
- there should be no need to specify currency in the payment account, since the whole point of Western Union is to work internationally regardless of currency
  - exception: countries with currencies in which Western Union has no presence in (a list should be made; but I assume most major countries are included)
  - it's possible users in some countries might not want to send money to users in certain other countries...in this case, country is already being specified in the payment account, and the offer taker can see it before accepting the offer. there should be no reason to completely block traders in different countries from taking western union offers.
- the trade protocol for Western Union currently requires payment sender to _email_ a copy of the receipt to the receiver...surely this can be changed, since trader chat is now available?
- fees are stupid high, obscene, and exorbitant (all at the same time)

With that said, Western Union's online bank-to-bank service seems to have a totally different fee structure (much more reasonable), and it might have potential as a new payment method...will investigate it over the next few days and open a new thread if it's worth adding to Bisq.",1,1,prediction_comments_bisq.csv

When searching the log the tx id and the broadcast attempt should be visible. If there are no logs for hearing back from peers then the broadcast did not get confirmed by back reporting peers and our timeout triggered the completion of the broadcast. The app logs a msg like:

I imagine that I could do so pseudonomously if I bought and installed password-protected delivery storage in my apartment where many people live. When I buy cash with XMR, I would just have cash delivered to the storage box which is shared with my neighbors.

What I imagine being tricky is that the trading partner might be a different one for every trade, thus there cannot be a recurring fiat bank transfer, as the receiver is different all the time.

17903,"Thanks for your interest and critical remarks.

Next time please consider posting to the [Bitsquare forum](https://forum.bitsquare.io/) as Github is Dev territory and you'll get better feedback over there.

You know, payment methods are a mixture of  thourough research and a little bit of trial and error. Banks write so much shit in their terms of service, faqs and everywhere, but still do different stuff in reality. We can't know for sure. For example, rumors say that SEPA chargebacks can happen, but in more than thousand (?) Bitsquare trades, there's not a single chargeback.

Your call at cXc is a single, unofficial voice and diametrically contradicts the cXc faq, which is why, at the moment, I'd go ahead recommending  them for US traders. I cannot know for sure, of course. There's no one in charge of Bitsquare, it's just a platform for people, who should at all times stay critically and keep questionning stuff. Make your own rational decision based on your knowledge and you should be fine.

Right now we've had more than 150 successful cXc trades on Bitsquare without a single chargeback. I can't answer your questions regarding cXc directly.

So, in your case, I'd recommend starting with small amounts and make yourself familiar with the process. On localbitcoins, traders offer paypal (trivial to chargeback) as payment method and charge a very high extra on their btc to make up for fraudsters.

Please close this, as it's not directly relevant here and let's discuss over at the message board for more opinions. Your voice is very welcome there!",1,1,prediction_comments_bisq.csv

My opinion is that Google translate is fine for a first draft. Why? Because otherwise it will never get done, just like HaikuOS. If something looks wrong the foreign language user will complain and tell us, you can be sure of that. But before, with no translation at all, he wasn't a user. So with a half-assed machine translation we are in a better position to find native speakers who will delight in ""correcting our awful French/Latvian/Whatever"".

18443,"OK, so in a nutshell, we can add it if it's on Polo or Bittrex but not otherwise.

Major exchanges tend to delete any coin that doesn't have sufficient trading volumes so this makes perfect sense. In fact it even applies to some minor fiat currencies, I notice someone wanted Kenyan Shillings recently. Dafuq.

To be totally consistent I think we should also start paring down the minor and unused alts before the next release. Candidates for removal are:

bitUSD, bitAUD, bitGBP, bitCNY, bitHKD, etc etc. In fact take out all the BitShares derivatives, it's a total scam.

Are you starting to see my point?

Just because a coin is on a major exchange and people trade it in volume doesn't make it any better or worse than any other. People are sheep and they don't investigate the code, the backers, the internet reports or the security aspects. And then they will scream blue murder when someone takes their money.

It comes down to this: Do we want to _look_ legitimate by acting as a pseudo-government ""nanny"" and trying to protect the buyers, or do we simply supply the facilities and let the market decide?

public static CxxLinkAndCompileRules createBuildRulesForCxxBinaryDescriptionArg

Where do args come from for that? I would like to add a new one.

`Linker.LinkableDepType linkStyle = args.getLinkStyle().orElse(

5865,"@illicitonion While it is not a ""huge burden"", it has the feeling of busy work.  The existing tests never covered the case where ``/usr/bin/gcc`` might change, and it feels like I'm being asked to add a test to cover a quite frankly more obscure scenario.  I consider it *highly* more likely that a user might do a ``yum upgrade gcc`` than the likelihood that a file named ``gcc`` that was previously in the path but not executable suddenly becomes so.

I don't mean to be a dick, but honestly I've spent a full day on this, and I'm not collecting a paycheck from Facebook.  My company doesn't even *have* any C/C++ code in a buck project; this honestly has nothing to do with our use of buck.  I've merely made this change because the process of submitting *other contributions* (namely improved kotlin support) became increasing painful when the continuous build jumped from 24 minutes to 45.  I understand that is not a pain that Facebook feels, as your continuous build servers are internal.

  [...]
```

Now you are screwed up, because Buck copying all files to `foo__srcs`, including `BUCK` file itself, and later, when you are trying to run `buck test` (note, that `buck build *` still works) it will complain that

```
//buck-out/.../foo: is not there or something

So now, all `glob(['**'])` must be extended with `srcs = glob(['**'], excludes = ['BUCK'])`, as in : [1]. May be this should be added to the documentation? Now it's claiming that:

Buck automatically excludes its own output, e.g. <code>buck-out</code>,

Things like HasClasspathEntries and HasSources don't really seem to fit. HasClasspathEntries is used indirectly by almost everything. When I make its methods return something more abstract it ends badly deep within AndroidBinaryGraphEnhancer.

2. Something is creating dirs under buck-out that you don't have access to.  Either the permissions are completely screwed up or perhaps you `sudo` ran something and left something behind.  We'd like to understand which of these it is so that we can figure out if this is a bug that we need to fix, or a general problem with surfacing unexpected conditions

7,"Just an Opinion 

In https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/12966 I have generated lots of reports regarding this check and see lots of project code in the report. The majority of the projects in which the switch contains fall-thru have mentioned the reason related to fall-thru and for that reason multiple times this keyword fall-thru is mentioned. and most cases this kind of comment is related to the reason why the case is fall-thru it is after the logic of that case. And if they are mentioning this case they might be aware that this is fall-thru and it's intentional. 

My view is why are we supposed to https://checkstyle.org/checks/coding/fallthrough.html#FallThrough:~:text=and%20must%20be%20on%20the%20last%20non%2Dempty%20line%20before%20the%20case%20triggering%20the%20warning%20or%20on%20the%20same%20line%20before%20the%20case%20(ugly%2C%20but%20possible) have this kind of rule that force to write a new comment `fall-thru` on new last empty line even they mentioned their reason above it and in that reason they multiple time use same-keyword. Isn't that annoying to them? And in case the reason or comment `fall-thru` is not mentioned then we show violation.

we should only look for the comment `fall-thru` from newline in a case group when the logic of that case is completed. ",1,1,prediction_comments_checkstyle.csv

Name could be `convertFilePathToForwardSlashedOnMismatch`(very ugly long, but clear and exact) but it is very long so result config will ugly, even more ugly than with `[\\/]`. Examples:
```
<suppress checks=""OuterTypeFilename""
  files=""[\\/]package-info\.java""/>

<!--  is it looks better  ?? -->

<suppress checks=""OuterTypeFilename""
  convertFilePathToForwardSlashedOnMismatch=""true""
  files=""/package-info\.java""/>

<suppress checks=""OuterTypeFilename""
  standardizeFileSeparator=""true""
  files=""/package-info\.java""/>
```

Rare cases of very detailed path:
```
<suppress checks=""PackageDeclarationCheck""
  files=""[\\/]resources[\\/].*[\\/]singlespaceseparator[\\/]InputSingleSpaceSeparatorEmpty\.java""/>

<!--  is it looks better  ?? -->

<suppress checks=""PackageDeclarationCheck""
  standardizeFileSeparator=""true""
  files=""/resources/.*/singlespaceseparator/InputSingleSpaceSeparatorEmpty\.java""/>

<suppress checks=""PackageDeclarationCheck""
  standardizeFileSeparator=""true"" 
  files=""/resources/.*/singlespaceseparator/InputSingleSpaceSeparatorEmpty\.java""/>
```

Even we decided to make it, I personaly would rather keep Checkstyle config on `[\\/]`
https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/config/checkstyle_resources_suppressions.xml
https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/config/sevntu_suppressions.xml
https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/config/suppressions.xml

without making it ` standardizeFileSeparator=""true""` as default (so there will be NO reference of it in config) , it might not benefit to use. In checkstyle code we do not have too much file conflicts between folders, we actually can remove most `[\\/]` and it will work,  we keep file separators as it does not hurt us that much.
We do not examine suppression files that often.

@viliam-durina , @pbludov , @snago ... please share votes and ideas. 
Please share your suppression configs, may be you have different view. 
Please share your use cases of suppression files. Why you need that minimization of `files` value ?

@strkkk Yeah there were a lot of Checkstyle violations, `new String[] {event.getFileName() }` this look ugly as only `}` is separated with whitespace, this could look like`new String[] { event.getFileName() }`, for that I would have to add `ARRAY_INIT` and `ANNOTATION_ARRAY_INIT` to default tokens list.

This check works for whitespaceAround both `{` and `}`, just add this to config.xml file

21058,"> https://abhishek-kumar09.github.io/checkstyleReports/reports/diff/index.html

@Abhishek-kumar09 you completely changed the behaviour of the `bracesAdjustment` property.

Please see https://abhishek-kumar09.github.io/checkstyleReports/reports/diff/checkstyle/index.html#A31009:
```java
 // basicOffset = 4
 // braceAdjustment = 2
public class InputIndentationBraceAdjustment //indent:0 exp:0
  { //indent:2 exp:2
    /** Creates a new instance of InputIndentationBraceAdjustment */ //indent:4 exp:4
    public InputIndentationBraceAdjustment() //indent:4 exp:4
      { //indent:6 exp:6
        // sorry about the religious commentary... :) //indent:8 exp:8
        boolean uglyGnuStyle = true; //indent:8 exp:8
```
The `bracesAdjustment` property should not affect the next level indentation.

So this code is indented correctly:
```java
 // basicOffset = 4
 // braceAdjustment = 2
if (foo)       // ident:0
  {              // braces: (+2)
    bar();    // ident:4 (+4)
    baz();    // ident:4 (+4)
  }              // braces: (+2)
else       // ident:0
    bar();    // ident:4, no braces around
```
This is not the style that Google suggests. For the Google it should be
```java
 // basicOffset = 4
 // braceAdjustment = 2
if (foo)     // ident:0
  {          // braces: +2
      bar(); // ident:6 (+2 +4)
      baz(); // ident:6 (+2 +4)
  }          // braces: +2
else         // ident:0
    bar();   // ident:4, no braces around
```

@romani @strkkk @rnveach we need a new property to satisfy the Google style.
What Google want is ""the left curly brace should be on the same line. When the left curly brace is on the next line, it should be indented.""

And this makes sense: for a regular code block it looks resonable, i.e.
```java
void foo() {
  int a;
  {  // code block
    { // another code block
      return 42;
    }
  }
}
```
and same should be applied for a code block of a switch case:
```java
  switch(val) {        // indent:2
    case 0:            // indent:4
      return 0;        // indent:6
    case 1:            // indent:4
      { // code block  // indent:6
        return 42;     // indent:8
      }                // indent:6
  }                    // indent:2

4.4: As mentioned by  @rnveach, #5089 shows this is false, but I would tend to say this is simply a bug and even in the current cached version there should be no green checkmark. The additional text just explains what was meant by the word character, but it was no content change, the rule is the same and is not followed correctly currently by checkstyle.

4.6.1: imho just nicer language, no content change

4.6.2: This one I actually overlooked initially. I think there is no rule yet to check these two? Actually for the ellipsis case there is even a rule in the checks that checks the opposite. (`NoWhitespaceBefore` with token type `ELLIPSIS`) For the array initializer there would also be an opposing rule (`NoWhitespaceAfter` with token type `ARRAY_DECLARATOR` which checks before is no space? wtf? It is not in the google checks, but why is this token tpye not handled in `NoWhitespaceBefore` instead? o_O)

I also mentioned in the issue the other benefits where powermock kept screwing us.
Some of the pitest.sh additions are simply because we overrely on powermock. `PackageNamesLoader` is the best example. It is hard coded to only bring in packages from a specific file. We had to use powermock because we couldn't modify the file in `main`. This class can easily be fixed to just need reflection to ""pretend"" we got the values from the file.

> Why do we need to follow IDEA Inspection if it is not appropriate in the current situation?

There is design principle that demands to treat all classes around as enemies. No friends at all. Class should not be damaged even around unreasonable hell is going on around. 
Immutable design is partly based on this principle.

IntelijIdea do make sense. If you want to ignore it, you need to keep only one ArrayList and share reference to it in all application (as we do know that nobody will change it).
You propose to have 2 copies, from 2 to 3 - there is no big difference.
We already kind of fanatically follow all static analysis rules, .... for example demanding final on variables, there are more and more cases. All of them do have their reason even minor , but reason.  

> So, do you support here our idea to create a new list each time the file is opened?

there is no other ways , how can I be against.

>You mean in getter? Why?

in `getLinesToPosition` as we need to be lazy. If you stand from position that you do not know how class is used, no extra copy should be there if nobody ask for it.

>in destination (CodeSelectorPresentation)

because from perspective of CodeSelectorPresentation there is no guaranty that list is not going to be modified, after it is set in CodeSelectorPresentation. Complete protection, a bit fanatical but .... .
If we start to use special type of immutable collection, then we have clear excuse to suppress - collection is immutable, content in immutable so it it is ok to share references. But we use mutable type so it is design problem and you have to pay for it.
Unfortunately there is no immutable collections in jdk, there bunch of them in other libraries, but extra dependencies are ok only for good reason.

-----------------

We could use https://google.github.io/guava/releases/snapshot/api/docs/com/google/common/collect/ImmutableList.html (we try to minimize guava, but heavily depend on it, so extra change in import control is ok, we use from guava collections that are not present in jdk for now, so it will just another). 
So we make immutable list ones at MainFrameModel and without any copy share it others. 
I still think that refactoring of TreeTable make sense.",1,1,prediction_comments_checkstyle.csv
37021,"@romani 
> There is design principle that demands to treat all classes around as enemies. No friends at all. Class should not be damaged even around unreasonable hell is going on around.
Immutable design is partly based on this principle.

Yes, I know this. It is not a point of my question. Why cannot we create the unmodifiable list view immediately after array list instantiation:
1. Open file
2. Create the new array list 
3. Get unmodifiable copy of the array list
4. Set the copy as the field value.

> IntelijIdea do make sense. If you want to ignore it, you need to keep only one ArrayList and share reference to it in all application (as we do know that nobody will change it).

If somebody tries to modify unmodifiable list he will get the exception as the list does not support operations which can change it. The idea of fail fast will work here. We prevent the error from spreading through the system to other classes.

> in getLinesToPosition as we need to be lazy. If you stand from position that you do not know how class is used, no extra copy should be there if nobody ask for it.

Thus, new unmodifiable view will be created each time somebody access the getter, isn't it? In addition, unmodifiable list from Java collection framework is a lightweight class, but immutable collection from Guava is not. Creation of a new unmodifiable list in getter will damage the performance a lot. 

> we try to minimize guava, but heavily depend on it, so extra change in import control is ok, we use from guava collections that are not present in jdk for now, so it will just another).

As long as we continue using Guava and adding new dependencies on it, we will increase the desire to use the library on and on.  May be it is a design problem, if we cannot avoid usage of extra library?

> lets vote:

I'm agains the option number 1. I still cannot understand why we need so many copies.

Current implementation of the check requires the following changes to the code:

```java
public class PaymentAuthorisationRefusedException {
    public PaymentAuthorisationRefusedException(String message,
                                                Throwable cause)
    {
        super(message, cause);
    }
}
```

or
```java
public class PaymentAuthorisationRefusedException {
    public PaymentAuthorisationRefusedException(String message,
        Throwable cause)
    {
        super(message, cause);
    }
}
```

It looks a bit ugly.

From my point of view, ```maxLineLength``` option was introduced to relax the check and to make it less controversial to LineLengthCheck. As you can see from the previous version of the documentation for NLOW:

```java
     * Represents the policy that if the brace will fit on the first line of
     * the statement, taking into account maximum line length, then apply
     * {@code EOL} rule. Otherwise apply the {@code NL}
     * rule. {@code NLOW} is a mnemonic for ""new line on wrap"".
```

 I remember that we decided to drop the option intentionally, however I believe that we did not take into account the case mentioned above. Note, that RightCurlyCheck does not have such option. I'm not sure whether it is a good idea to return the option. It is not check's responsibility to treat line length, in addition, NLOW was designed to validate other types of code style mistakes. http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/property_types.html#lcurly#lcurly

Reports calls to the regular expression methods of java.lang.String using constants arguments. Such calls may be profitably replaced with a private static final Pattern field so that the regular expression does not have to be compiled each time it is used.

Should I suppress the violation? 
Another way out is to pre-compile 3 remove patterns and use the following ugly code just to satisfy IDEA's inspection that would be incorrect:

This PR fixes switch statement calculation and implements return statement calculation as described in Nejmeh's article, issue #146 is unrelated. Personally i think issue author is wrong in his thought that check should analyze code blocks and determine if there is an exit point.
Issue  #616 (continue and break statements) is hard to solve because we have to store additional data about all loops we have entered (labeled break statements would be particulary hard), this is beyond stack calculator we have now.

Indeed the update is huge because i had to reclassify tokens according to the way how their expressions are placed in AST and add additional stack for the storing expression values. I understand that regression testing wille be hard, i compared my report with pmd report with an ad-hoc modified patch-diff-report-tool with guava as tested code and found that i have about 75% coincidences. However there are inaccuraces in pmd itself.

Explanation of Alone option:
http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html#s4.1.2-blocks-k-r-style
So we have to be strict with ""alone"" mode so instance initialization should be marked as violation, as you have it in your report already.
If users start complaining about that - we will introduce new option smth like ""waiverParentToken"" to let users define that instance initialization braces should be skipped. But that should be done as different issue.

> And indeed it doesn't matter for a caller which type of problem with reflection occurred.

Question is not about what caller care about, you need to take a look at method that throws exceptions.
You can have multiple caller methods, but 'throw' method will always be one and it need to satisfy both of them. As throws-method can not wrap exceptions he has to deliver all that crap to caller. If caller to not like that he always have an option to use other methods or do ...... .

> I don't see any connection between static methods and throws count. Am I missing something?

That was my immature idea to suppress that check on static methods. Static methods should be like utils methods inside of class. So util method have no right to do logging or partly hide problems - report all or suppress all exceptions (example: string to int conversion or smth similar .... ). 
But I am not ready now to do detailed analysis of all java sources to claim that is good practice for all projects.  Please feel free to skip my note about static methods.

from private conversation with KTannenberg :

Making class and all its members final closely resembles Case classes from Scala (but with inheritance being disabled).

However if you make such classes non-final and thus allow inheritance from them (while still designing class as immutable), you can end up in situation where you have child class with mutable behaviour. There are couple of problems I see here:
1. You would lose consistency in member access. As sole purpose of this check is to omit boilerplate get/set code in Base class, you would be forced to access parent's members with dot sythax and child's members with getter call
2. You can put Child instances in Collection<Base> and get problems with hashCode()/equals(). And don't say me that noone would do such kind of crap... well maybe you and I wouldn't  :)

Best solution would be to use case classes from Scala, but there are also some cons:
1. You would need to move to Scala

```
class Widget {
   constructor(...children) { ... }
   build() { ... }
}
```

Each widget has a `tag` and an array of `classes`. To override them without fields, we have to do:
```
class CustomWidget extends Widget {
    constructor(...children) {
        super(...children);
        this.tag = 'h1';
        this.classes = [ 'class1', 'class2' ];
    }
}
```
and add `this.tag = '', this.classes = []` field sets in the `Widget` constructor. Not the end of the world, but pretty hideous when it could be:
```
class Widget {
    // defaults
    tag = 'div';
    classes = ['widget'];

    constructor(...children) {...}
    build() {...}
}
```
and extend with literally just:
```
class CustomWidget extends MyWidget {
    tag = 'h2';
    classes = ['custom-widget'];
}
```

To override the `this.tag` and `this.classes` properties on the call to constructor. We want these properties to be ready for when `this.build()` is called in the future, and this pattern is the most effective way to accomplish this simple use case.

It should really be that simple to transpile fields.  Setting a field `name = val;` inside a class just results in a `this.name = val;` in the constructor.

Currently ProcessCommonJSModules depends on very specific implementation details of how class ASTs are traversed.

The fact that the first child may be visited in its sibling's scope, but the second child must always go before means that we must traverse the children out of order, and I don't know if that will break anything.

These 3 errors occur when I compile the largest monolithic part of our codebase. This includes a common script which registers a couple of old polyfills.

The same script is included by other builds which DON'T produce these warnings. So I have been unable to narrow it down in that way.

However I have whittled down the included common script to the bare minimum such that the 3 warnings still occur (when compiling the large monolithic code):

goog.provide(""X"");

  var objCtr = Object;

- goog.Promise, throw uncaught exceptions (basically using a setTimeout to keep it out of the current chain of events). 
- That the first form you suggest as valid doesn't catch catch any exception in the last ""resFn"".  You almost always want a "".catch"".

The real problem is that it is difficult to know when you are ""done"" with an promise.  You don't want to say this is bad:

``` javascript
/** @return {Promise<string>} */ function getSomething() {
   return doSomething().then(resFn);
}
```

or this:

``` javascript
var promise = doSomething();  // no catch

var x = promise.then(resFn);  // no catch
store(x);

var y = fetch(x);
y.catch(value);
```

 We could certainly say an ""unconsumed"" promise must have a ""catch"".  But even that would catch cases like this:

``` javascript
var initP;
function init() {
   // ... do something to 
   if (initP != null) {
     initP = new Promise(...);  // resolve when initialized
   }
   return initP;

init();  // start the init but don't care when it finishes.

If `path/to/shared/library.js` is a `goog.module` and you want to import it from ES6, you'd need to move it to `path/to/shared/library.legacy.js` and create an ES6 module at `path/to/shared/library.js` in its place that re-exports, wouldn't you?

5854,"> I don't think that's good enough if you don't want to assume things. For per-file transpilation across modules, it requires a runtime check of the module type. What property an import references is dependent on both the host and target module types.

Right, and because you know what was an Es6 module input you can add the __esModule property to it. The same way babel and other CJS transformers do things.

Anyways I think this may need a lot larger discussion here since I realizing how module rewriting is done in the compiler today is a huge blocker for this in general. Ordering sucks because every rewrite module step renames module scoped variables. So as it stands today you cannot actually move rewriting of references to _module type_ into _rewriter for module type_ because if it runs after some other module rewriter has run the local names are all already globalized.

> And I don't use per file transpilation and would love it if that use case wasn't supported. But as long as it is I figured I'd raise the issues that have to be addressed.

Same here, at least with regards to ClosureBundler. Hotswap passes are not going away. But as it stands today CJS isn't compatible with ClosureBundler so it doesn't need to worry about it. It isn't compatible with ES6 modules either and I want to add support for them for internal people. Ideally it goes way but adding support is probably faster than killing it.

There are work arounds, obviously. You can pass an input to the compiler that sets `CLOSURE_[UNCOMPILED_]DEFINES` and it will 1) output that to the bundle and 2) respect that in a compile. Then it is a lot clearer that those are Closure defines only.",1,1,prediction_comments_closurecompiler.csv

> We actually already have a case where whitespace only mode runs the checks (when we are transpiling from ES6 down to ES3/5), so it's reasonable to just run check unconditionally, and add this logic to the beginning of getChecks in DefaultPassConfig.

(for https://github.com/visokio/closure-compiler/commit/48240823475e2fff8ec9e30e8aec4bb5cc99ceec)

I did see that you have:
- ""do checks?"" => doChecks() method
- ""skip non transpilation passes"" => on a case by case basis, disable checks and actually only do transpilation

However:
- Transpilation isn't ""checks"". It doesn't feel right having ""checks"" called when transpiling only.
- ""goog.module"" bundling in whitespace only mode isn't a check, nor is it transpilation. I'm using ES6 to ES6 with Chrome (now stable). (Which works beautifully.)  I don't want to run anything unless I have to, for fast refresh in development.

So this bundling doesn't fit into ""do checks"" or ""do transpilation / skip non-transpilation"". Hence I added a pass ""always pre-checks"", terrible name I admit, for this exclusive case of bundling.

It doesn't make sense to have to turn on checks or transpilation to get whitespace only mode to work with goog modules. Please give me some suggestions to adapt this so this PR could be accepted.

11161,"The only remaining issue I see now, is that now we have a problem with transpiling in WHITESPACE_ONLY, in that goog.modes are rewritten twice. Once in this pass, and once by the old ClosureRewriteModule.

This sample compiles with no warnings. Now try this sample:

var f = new FakePlayer();
f.seek();

13688,"This is something I would also like to have available when using Closure Compiler, mainly to get the compiler to spit out an error if an attempt is made to instantiate an abstract/base type. Abstract functions (i.e. class methods) are something I'm not concerned about here.

``` js

 * @constructor
 * @abstract
 */
ns.Fruit = function() { ... }

var fruit = new ns.Fruit() // triggers a compiler error

/**

ns.Banana = function() { ... }

that's a distance we currently don't have an annotator for that.  However,
you can probably use the tokensregex annotator for things such as yards,

only a couple hundred team names, including past, present, cities, and

Problem one:
Strings given as input which contain no valid words hang the parser. E.g. a very long string of ""++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++------------------------------------------------------------"" will just hang the parser (shorter variants of this nonsense will return). 
Solution: do a check of the input data to ensure there is at least one alphabet character in the string

Extremely long (but valid sentences) will cause the same error. Solution: swap the parser for the alternative CoreNLP Lex Parser ",1,1,prediction_comments_corenlp.csv

Nicki Minaj has confirmed rumours that she's dating Eminem, after answering a fan's question on Instagram on Thursday. The Chun-Li rap beauty, 35, took to the image-sharing app to promote a new single she's featured on — YG's Big Bank, alongside 2 Chainz and Big Sean — when one of her followers boldly enquired: 'You dating Eminem???'Trinidadian-born Nicki, who was most recently romantically linked to 44-year-old rap veteran Nas, simply wrote back: 'Yes.'Making sweet music together? Nicki Minaj, left, confirmed that she's dating fellow rapper Eminem, right, during an exchange with a fan on Instagram on Thursday Interestingly, she mentions Eminem during her verse on Big Bank, rapping: 'Uh oh/Back again/Back to back Maybach, stack the M's/Told 'em I met Slim Shady, bag the M/Once he go black, he'll be back again.'MailOnline has contacted representatives for Nicki Minaj and Eminem for comment. While it's unknown if Nicki was being serious in her response to the enquiring fan, she and Eminem — real name Marshall Mathers III — have long known each other, as they worked together on her hit 2010 single Roman's Revenge.After the track's release, Nicki revealed that she sent the rap superstar another track before they landed on Roman's Revenge, telling MTV News: 'He didn't say, ""I don't love it""; he just said, ""Can you send me something that's a little more me??""' Screenshot: On Thursday night, a fan took to Twitter to share a screenshot of the exchange Letting loose: Nicki took to Instagram on Friday to promote a new single she's featured on — YG's Big Bank, alongside 2 Chainz and Big Sean - when she made the confession Loving life: Nicki looked in good spirits in the video as she rapped to the camera whilst casually clad in a red padded jacket and printed baseball cap whilst sporing bright pink lipstick Once they settled on the Swizz Beatz-produced beat for Roman's Revenge, next came the lengthy writing process, which Nicki described as 'competitive'.'I remember, every time I wrote a verse to Roman's Revenge and sent it to Eminem, he would send a new verse back,' she told XXL. 'It was competitive, it was fun.'I think all the big male artists (air quotes) also treated me with a sense of respect as an emcee. They took me serious. If they were on a track with me, they knew they had to come hard.'At the start of January, it was confirmed that Nicki and Nas had parted ways in December after the strain of a long-distance relationship proved 'too much', with Nicki living on the west coast in Beverly Hills and Nas based in New York City. Looking: Late last year, Eminem — real name Marshall Mathers III — opened up about looking for love more than a decade after the end of his marriage to Kimberly Anne Scott (pictured)The couple are believed to have started dating in June 2017, but sources close to the situation told TMZ 'the relationship ran out of steam'.An insider added: 'They respect each other, and there won't be any trash talking — but, on the other hand, they won't be hanging out as friends either.'The site also pointed to recent reports claiming Nicki — real name Onika Tanya Maraj — was pregnant with the couple's child, but states there was 'no truth' in the rumour.Nas, born Nasir Bin Olu Dara Jones, is now said to be focusing on his record label and his chicken and waffles joint, Sweet Chick, in the wake of the split, while Nicki also juggles 'multiple business ventures outside of music'.At the time, neither party addressed the reports via their social media channels. The ex factor: In January, it was revealed that her romance with Nas had come to an end, after seven months of dating. Pictured in June 2017, when they are believed to have got togetherThe last interaction between the pair was when Nas wished Nicki a happy birthday via his Instagram page on December 8, writing: 'Get The MFkN Money! Happy Birthday To The QUEEN OF NY / HIP HOP @nickiminaj.' Nicki and Nas have been friends for many years, but never formally confirmed rumours they were dating.A source claimed in September: 'Nicki and Nas are just very dear friends nothing romantic. They've been friends forever and have seen each other's careers take off.'Nas is a best friend to her so as of now nothing is stirring up. People always joke around though that they make a great couple!' Moving on: The couple are believed to have started dating in June 2017, but sources close to the situation have claimed 'the relationship ran out of steam'In May of last year, the Super Bass hitmaker declared that she was 'celibate' and 'hated men'. But interestingly she said she was willing to make an exception for her long-time friend Nas.Speaking on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Nicki said: 'I'm just chillin' right now. I'm celibate. I wanted to go a year without dating any man. I hate men. I might make an exception to the rule for [Nas], because he's so dope.'Nicki previously dated fellow rapper Meek Mill, 31, for two years from early 2015 to January 2017. Close: Nicki and Nas have been friends for many years, but never formally confirmed rumours they were dating throughout the course of their relationshipThe musician was in a long-term relationship with hip hop artist Safaree Samuels, 36, from 2000 to 2014. Nas has daughter Destiny, 23, with his former fiancée Carmen Bryan, and son Knight, eight, with his ex-wife, R&B singer Kelis, 38.The couple tied the knot in Atlanta, Georgia, in 2005 after two years together.Kelis filed for divorce four years later in April 2009, just three months before welcoming the couple's son, with the split finalized the following year in May 2010.Nas is also believed to have briefly dated actress and singer Mary J. Blige, 46. Long-time pals: The rapper, 35, and the hip-hop star, 44, were said to have parted ways back in December, after the strain of a long-distance relationship proved 'too much'For his part, in December Eminem opened up about looking for love more than a decade after the end of his marriage to high school sweetheart Kimberly Anne Scott. The rapper, who was married twice to Kimberly until their second divorce in 2006, revealed he's used the dating app Tinder, as well as jokingly referencing the use of gay app Grindr, and has even gone to strip clubs to meet women.'It's tough,' the 45-year-old told Vulture. 'Since my divorce I've had a few dates and nothing's panned out in a way that I wanted to make it public. Dating's just not where I'm at lately.'It's not certain if the rapper was joking about his methods for meeting people, but aside from Tinder, Eminem also said he would also try to find dates on Grindr and at strip clubs. 'And Grindr,' he told the interviewer with a laugh. 'Queen of NY': The last interaction between the pair on social media was when Nas wished Nicki a happy birthday via his Instagram page on December 8'Going to strip clubs is how I was meeting some chicks,' he added. 'It was an interesting time for me.'The 8 Mile star assured the interviewer he wasn't lonely, answering whether fame had left him feeling isolated: 'Am I lonely? No, I’m good. Thanks for asking though.'Eminem was first married to Kimberly from 1999 to 2001, before re-marrying her in 2006. Their second marriage was short-lived as well, with the couple divorcing again that same year.Together Eminem and Kimberly have daughter Hailie, who turned 22 on Christmas Day. Kim also has daughter Whitney from another relationship, who Eminem adopted. The couple also adopted Kim's late sister Dawn's daughter Alaina.

You can also run a bunch of sentences such as ""Ian Laperrière sucks as a PK coach"" through the parser, then replace the tags such as NP etc with the sentiment labels.  

Perhaps you could put together a better tool which labels trees.  I don't think we have such a thing.

Note that the trees need to be fully binarized for use in the sentiment tool.  Honestly it's been a while, so I can't remember which option in the parser forces it to output binarized trees.",1,1,prediction_comments_corenlp.csv
2497,"This seems a larger issue. I tested kbp on larger datasets and got many errors due to ProtobufAnnotationSerializer that could often be traced back to the ""fromProto(CoreNLPProtos.SentenceFragment fragment, SemanticGraph tree)"" method.  
The problem seems to be that the stream over the fragmentTree concurrently modifies the data structure. I solved the problem by having the changes done on a soft copy of the fragmentTree:
`// Apparently this sometimes screws up the tree

    SemanticGraph fragmentTree2 = fragmentTree.makeSoftCopy();

    fragmentTree.vertexSet().stream()

        .filter(vertex -> fragmentTree.getFirstRoot() != vertex &&

            tree.getFirstRoot() != vertex &&

            !fragmentTree.incomingEdgeIterable(vertex).iterator().hasNext())

        .forEach(vertex -> {
          SemanticGraphEdge edge = tree.incomingEdgeIterable(vertex).iterator().next();

          fragmentTree2.addEdge(fragmentTree2.getFirstRoot(), edge.getDependent(), edge.getRelation(),

              edge.getWeight(), edge.isExtra());

        });
    // Return the fragment

    //noinspection SimplifiableConditionalExpression

    return new SentenceFragment(fragmentTree2,

        fragment.hasAssumedTruth() ? fragment.getAssumedTruth() : true,
        false)

        .changeScore(fragment.hasScore() ? fragment.getScore() : 1.0);`

Since, for some reason, the (de)serialization of the annotation is an integral part of KBP, it would be nice to have that fixed, rather than using a fixed copy of the ProtobufAnnotationSerializer.

For example, if I apply OpenIE algorithm on the Sentiment Treebank (http://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/treebank.html), it'll fail to find a relation, 3704 times (on 9645 sentences). It's almost 40%..

Like the review ""A gripping , searing portrait of a lost soul trying to find her way through life"" doesn't give results..

It isn't written on the documentation of OpenIE, the algorithm fails on several classical texts:
- ""I throw away my laptop""
- ""It doesn't work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice, or that our political opponents are unpatriotic."" (Obama State of the Union speech)
- ""Most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn't matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some narrow interest.""

That said, RE your particular examples:
- ""I throw away my laptop"" -- I've fixed this
- ""It doesn't work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice, or that our political opponents are unpatriotic."" -- This has a negation in it, which is apparently mis-scoped. Negated statements are not extracted by design.
- ""Most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn't matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some narrow interest."" -- I suspect the words ""Most"" and ""all"" screw this up, as the system considers them quantifiers. But, more generally, it's unclear what relation should be extracted from this? Perhaps ""democracy breaks down""? The part of the sentence after ""when"" is a hypothetical and shouldn't be extracted by the system.
- ""Things don't have to change the world to be important."" -- Negation again.
- ""A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them."" -- Negation again.
- ""This product works terribly"" -- This is actually not the ""this"" problem, but rather the fact that ""terribly"" is an adverb. Really, this is a unary relation, where ""works terribly"" is an atomic relation applied to ""this product."" To illustrate, take the analogous sentence ""the boy ate quickly."" Clearly it would be incorrect to extract that the boy ate something, and that something was ""quickly.""

This vid shows me opening the table after having set the fetch size to 500K--it results in a Java Heap Space exception (no out of mem exception this time) after reaching 83K loaded rows--I ran this twice and got 2 diff behaviors:

I added this vid because while I was screwing around with the recorder app and stopping/restarting DBeaver I got a Class loader exception... I guess I restarted the app too fast maybe while it hadn't released the lock yet?  But this is an exception that does also occur once in a blue moon under normal use, ie just after launching DBeaver for the first time BUT also already having SSMS running.  It seems as if SSMS and DBeaver are not good neighbors when running at the same time.

My issue is that when I want to select a set of columns to display, it has become extremely difficult. It worked very well until this last release. For the last release the tick boxes in selecting the columns to display have been changed. I experience the following problems:
1. I have to click from 3 to more than 10 times before I manage to get a tick mark. 
2. The last tick is always ignored - I have to add an extra tick mark anywhere to actually display the columns I want
3. Previous selections display as if still selected but it ignores any change in selection

Let me reiterate - until the last vserion of DBeaver this worked so well and then for no rhyme ort reason it was changed. Why change a perfectly working piece of code? And then to utterly destroy usability in the process? It is horrible!

18836,"it is **common practice to most companies** (that I know) to abide by the following process : 

1. in order to **properly separate all stages of development** each of them hold a **copy** (at least in structure) of the relevant **database(s)**. 
2. this means there are at least data-sources for the usual stages: **production, testing, development.** (and possibly more) 
3. when a particular **query** is required to be executed it is **executed in the development database first** and modified until all kinks are worked out (iterative upward through the stages development, testing, production).
4. this query can be tied to a somewhat recurring task or something else that makes reuse required. meaning the query is not only used once, but **saved and later executed again** (with slight modifications, abiding the process shown in 3. starting in the development phase)
5. when you replicate this with a set of query-files interrupting in different stages you will see that they **end up randomly tied to one of these data-sources**

    - even when properly set back the  issue for testing and development still remains 
    - please assume switching of task, closing of the application or even shutting down of the workstation between work

6. **this results** in the real world issue that **only a subset of files are shown in 'open sql script' dialog** based on the data source they were left of at 
     - e.g. to find out which of these many scripts was the most(second/third...) recent file independent of the data source is a quite a hassle
      - or to just open up the desired file through the dialog while still  having another data source selected

Dbeaver created the field with the space .. no complaints.

Postgres when I loaded another editor showed this field as “logo_url “ rather than logo_url

29294,"Dear Ksenia
thank you for your reply.

Here's the example of my problem.
Let's say we have a script 'truncate_all.sql' that truncates all tables in the database. Very dangerous, right?
1. Now, I set up the PRODUCTION system for first run and execute this script against the PRODUCTION database. Database clean, users may start using the system.
2. Users start saving data in production database.
3. A few days later I'm opening the DEVELOPMENT database and want to get rid of trash data from tables.
4. So, I'm connected to DEVELOPMENT database, I open the same 'truncate_all.sql' and hit Run button. 
Here the disaster begins.
Dbeaver reads metadata of the 'truncate_all.sql' file and finds out it was used with PRODUCTION database, switches to the PRODUCTION database - with no warning whatsoever! - and sends all users' precious data to hell by truncating all tables...

The Preferences -> Scripts window says:
""by default association of your SQL scripts with database connections is kept in internal workspace files""
And you may only pick the option saving this information in a SQL script.
You cannot disable completely this feature.

I would like to 
- disable use of
or 
- have DBeaver ignore 
the file-related metadata and NOT SWITCH the databases without my explicit decision.

Hi Serge!
Here there's the dbeaver thread dump (catched during a hanging event...).

I confirm you that the last version of dbeaver where the issue was not present was 6.1.5: I install every single release of the software... the issue raised in the passage from rel 6.1-5 to 6.2.0.

I'm a team leader of 5 people... I convinced all my collaborators to use Dbeaver (cause the default Teradata query tool, SQL Assistant, sucks... :-) ) . All of them have the same problem.

I reapplied my custom CA cert and everything worked flawlessly.
That's when I realized that when I redid my configuration for my test earlier, I was using the `root` user instead of the user I was initially testing with.
From there, I drilled down and discovered that I had never given the user permission to access any databases, so I am now assuming that ""this user has no access to anything"" was the ""internal error"" that DBeaver encountered.

This issue didn't appear when using `cockroach sql` because it let me connect with that user.  Based on that I didn't catch the permissions issue, but I assume that if I had actually tried to run any queries they would have failed and I would have seen the problem much faster.

905,"### Resource Management

A conversation with @cheddar revealed one of the key goals of the `Sequence` abstraction: the ability to manage resources. It works so well that he says Druid has seldom experienced a query-related resource leak. Pretty darn good!

As @cheddar observed, an operator is little more than a closable iterator, with some goodies tacked on, and closeable iterators are resource leaks waiting to happen.

There is more than one way to handle the problem, however. As it turned out, Drill originally did the ""every operator has to ensure it is closed"" thing. It was a complex mess. (We didn't have `Sequence` to help.) Then Drill let it's fragment runner do the work. The code became much simpler and resource leaks disappeared, even in nasty error situations.

The operator prototype learned from Drill's experience. The operator ""DAG"" is managed by a fragment runner which knows of every operator in the DAG, and which ensures that, come hell or high water, the operators are closed. The result is that the data path (`hasNext()`/`next()`) is as simple as possible since it need not handle every possible error case that needs closing. Operators can release resources early if they can, but they don't have to: they're still guaranteed to be released at the end.

So, operators solve the ""close problem"" while providing a super-simple (and efficient) data path. This is why the pattern is widely used in many projects. This is reflected in the stack traces above: the current code has extra layers, in part, to ensure that we use accumulators that can close resources. The operator stack is simpler because resource management sits on the side, discretely out of sight of the data path.

We could certain use the same trick with a `Sequence`: register each one with a sequence context, and that context can ensure everything is closed. While that make the yielder code a bit simpler, it would still leave substantial complexity. Let's tackle that next.",1,1,prediction_comments_druid.csv
1015,"@clintropolis, thanks for the explanation. Again, this is philosophical. Druid started as a super-fast storage engine with its own query semantics. The ""native"" queries showed what Druid could (and could not) do. It was the job of the application developer to use those building blocks to perform some given task.

Once SQL enters in the picture, us users kind of hope that the SQL engine will work out how to ""make it so"" to make a given query work. That's what Drill, Presto and Impala do: no matter how ugly the SQL (and I've seen statements thousands of lines long), the engine ""does the right thing"", even if that ""thing"" makes you cringe.

The key thing to realize is that a data analyst has to do whatever is required of them; not just what the storage engine makes easy. If Druid does not support operation *x*, because *x* would be slow, then us poor app developers just have to find some way to code it in the app, probably with multiple queries, which makes the result even slower. Ain't no free lunch...

For example, for this case the workaround is to use two `ORDER BY` queries. If Druid did the `MIN()` and `MAX()` operation, the query could use a single unordered pass over the data. With the workaround, the data must be sorted twice. The overall result to the user is much slower.

I wonder if there is some way to use Drill or Presto to do the queries? Drill has a Druid connector, don't know about Presto. Then, Druid gets to say ""pure"", and I could delegate the ugly real-world queries to a tool that can handle them.

1661,"Hi @damnMeddlingKid , @ericxiao251, (and sorry I missed the mailing list thread)

I did document this behavior recently in #11188, which includes a new column that lists out all of the initial aggregator values in both modes, https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/docs/querying/sql.md#aggregation-functions. 

Whether or not this is the most correct thing for min/max to be doing I would consider this fair game to be up for debate. As mentioned in this thread already, in SQL compatible null handling mode these aggregators are initialized to the null value, and so not aggregating any rows will produce the expected `null` result, which in my personal view seems like the only correct thing to do in the case where filters do not match, but that doesn't work for default mode of course.

As alluded to by @abhishekagarwal87, I don't think we could make the 'default' mode min/max aggregators return `0` either without storing some additional information to distinguish not aggregating values (so probably no longer using the primitive numeric base aggregators, or perhaps always using the nullable version and just coercing to 0 later?), or by dropping the very end values and assuming Long.MIN_VALUE and Long.MAX_VALUE don't legitimately exist and translating them to 0 in a finalizer, which would allow them to keep using the numeric primitive aggregator base classes.

""default"" null handling mode is often unintuitive I think, especially in SQL queries, and for the most part SQL compatible null handling mode should have behavior that is more consistent with other databases and with what you would expect in SQL. I would much prefer long term to deprecate and eventually remove default value mode, so that this case of no matches always returns null, but it seems reasonable to discuss adjusting the default values for default value mode until then.

I don't have a strong opinion on the default value for min/max... what is the motivation to have 0 instead of an unlikely value returned when nothing matches? Or is this just confusion since none of this was previously explicitly documented so the only reference was the documentation on the two null handling modes?

2229,"> it sucks that we need to implement grow-ability to save cost of zeroing out where we already have allocated all the memory or is there any other advantage?.

The problem is the memory is not initialized when we allocated it, so it has garbage in it, and therefore we need to initialize the parts we're going to use. And initialization can take a while if your buffer size is big (like a gigabyte, as some people do).

> Instead, if we reserved numBucket bytes at the start of buffer and used those for marking.

I bet it would be faster, especially if we use the Memory.clear API. I did some work to migrate some of the groupBy code to use Memory instead of ByteBuffer (#9308, #9314; see also MemoryBenchmark) partially motivated by performance. If we moved this part too it should help with initialization speed.

I looked into this a little bit and I think I'm okay with Nishants approach to fix this with the `CalciteTestBase` class. It makes sense why he did it, since once the Calcite classes get loaded up and read the calcite specific System properties for configuration, they are stuck like that for the life of the JVM. This was an easy solve to make sure that the system properties were correct for the life of the JVM.  It is not obvious to developers to add this unless they reference other tests that touch Calcite that they should extend his base class, which sucks. I'm not sure there is a way to configure Calcite without using System properties and Calcites.java seems to indicate the same in a from the comments in Calcites.setSystemProperties(). 

TravisCI passing despite all of this has me scratching my head. Maybe the tests are running in a different order than on local..? Or someone in the past messed with the configuration to get past this?

I definitely agree here, I've been looking at the recently added Dropwizard emitter for inspiration, to see if it would maybe make sense to have something based on Dropwizard (or something like that) available in core to allow re-use for any sorts of periodic/rate driven metrics we might want to collect. Though rather than the Dropwizard emitter, instead a common core piece would collect these metrics and periodically emit the snapshot of their current values to whatever the actual emitters are. I plan to look into this deeper sometime after this PR.

>it sucks that to enable these metrics, I would have to write an extension. I haven't read through the thread in #6559 yet but will hopefully check that out sometime this week.

I agree here as well; I think maybe having some sorts of common profile implementations of `QueryMetrics` out of the box like 'default', 'none', 'all', 'query-tuning', etc, might be the easiest approach for now, though it's probably worth opening a discussion again to see if we can come up with any better ideas.

26850,"@leventov @cheddar Interesting discussion.   I just have a few comments

-  ""Don't make a lot of Object copies when a `Memory` object has to be ""sliced"", ..."".  The `MemoryRegion(R)` is a view of its parent as ""slice"" is for ByteBuffer; no data is copied. 

If the concern is the over-creation of these shell objects, with `Memory` you could create a read-only view of the parent once, and then just pass the offset and permitted length to the downstream users of some sub-chunk; no object creation at all.  This is a little messy for the downstream users but safe.  With BB this is not possible, because the position, limit, etc are always writable, which could screw up the parent.

- `MagicAccessorImpl`.  I've been looking at this and it concerns me.  

1. It brings in yet another hierarchy of dependencies (org.objectweb.asm), which could make maintenance & debugging rather challenging.
2. Creating a `DirectByteBuffer` requires calling the internal `Bits.reserveMemory()` and `unreserveMemory()`, which call the `sun.misc.SharedSecrets()` that keeps track of all created instances of `DirectByteBuffer` so that they can be properly freed.  I don't see any mechanisms in the `MagicAccessorImpl` that does this.  Of course, I may not fully grok how it works :).

- Using the JVM `Cleaner`. Although this might be possible, the Java gurus that I have spoken with, who work on the internals of the JVM, advise me to never use `Cleaner` as it can be quite dangerous (and hazardous to your mental health :) ).  This and the above point are why I don't recommend trying to create a `DirectByteBuffer` from a `Memory`.  Creating a `HeapByteBuffer` from `Memory` is trivial and can be done with the current code.

- `Memory` already has read-only implementations of `NativeMemory` and `MemoryRegion`.

- `Memory` has no dependencies outside Java, and you can think of it as a wrapper around `Unsafe`.   This being the case, it would be possible to create classes in `Memory` that leverage the same `UnsafeUtil` and include position, limit, rewind, etc.  But, is this really necessary? Being able to read old data should not be a problem, but using `Memory` is a different programming paradigm that new downstream applications would need to get used to. 

- `Memory` was designed as a fast mechanism for random access of different primitive types sharing the same backing memory, similar to a C `struct` and `union` combined.  `ByteBuffer` was designed for fast stream-based IO buffer operations, for which it does a splendid job.   Reading a TCP/IP packet stream cannot be read with a random access paradigm so there is no choice.  Reading data from RAM can be read either in a random access paradigm or sequentially, which depends on the application. But it seems to me to be overly restrictive for Druid to require that downstream processes **must** use a sequential paradigm in order to process their data out of RAM.  Processing sketch data structures is a good example that requires random access, but I'm sure there will be many others.

Converting Druid away from `ByteBuffers` will be a lot of work no matter what path is chosen.

""Could you elaborate on what's wrong with Cleaner? It's been added recently to a few places in the Druid code base and if it's scary I'd like to understand why.""
I just found out that our corp email was screwing up and has not been sending my replies :(  !!I have a hunch that a number of my replies have been going into a bit-bucket!So here is the reply I sent at noon today.

- Creates another dependency on a non-public internal set of classes of the JVM.- It is not clear to me that Cleaner is essential, or at least it hasn't been essential so far.  

More: There is no way to achieve from Java the performance attained using Unsafe and this is why it is so widely used. Cleaner, on the other hand, is a convenience in that it allows programmers not to have to worry about freeing resources that they have allocated.  

Overusing Cleaner can cause contention, and block GC operations. See https://srvaroa.github.io/java/jvm/unsafe/2016/08/28/sun-misc-cleaner.html.

There are other attempts to create public Cleaners, but from what I have read, with varied success.
DirectByteBuffers (DBBs) are created with a messy process inside the JVM using VM calls, Bits.reserveMemory(), which calls an internal SharedSecrets() that tracks all instances of DBB. and of course Cleaner.  

I do not recommend attempting to create your own DirectByteBuffers outside the JVM.  And I don't recommend attempting to create a DBB from a Memory object.  Create DBBs sparingly, and reuse them if you can.

`ByteBuffer.allocate()` is used 152 times, `allocateDirect()` - 6 times, `Files.map()` - 9 times.

> We already have a finalize in Memory incase someone forgets to free explicitly. Finalize will be slower, but it is very infrequent.

 - The problem is OOMs because of inability to reclaim finalizable objects on a given GC phase. Allocating larger objects only makes it worse.
 - Currently StupidPool of ByteBuffers allocates as many ByteBuffers as ResourceHolders, the effect of changing that resource holders from using `finalize()` to `Cleaner` [is big](https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/3892#issuecomment-276766936). It was N ByteBuffer (Cleaner) + N ResourceHolders (`finalize()`). It is changed to N ByteBuffers (Cleaner) + N ResourceHolders (Cleaner).

9229,"The proposed solution would shield the users to perform inconsistent backups on separate media. The good thing is that if the media used for backups of the snapshots is of different nature like tapes or much slower disks or devices that are not always connected, it would help. 
However it might be that it would not shield users from some other sources of inconsistencies like the underlying support for snapshot randomly not being consistent. I believe that the mechanic put in place should prevent immediately  to backup inconsistent data once that is detected.
The initially proposed approach would help only and only if it would detect immediately some consistency issue on the support used to store the initial snapshots. The idea is to prevent any possibility to backup any inconsistent data (i.e. on tapes). Should it not be the case, if there are issues on the underlying support where initial snapshots are made (i.e: underlying support (disk) degrades progressively or is not reliable giving random value while reading), then backup would not be usable. It could be a goog thing if possible to detect that situation as soon as possible.

I also think that there is another scenario that is not covered when users need and wants to reassure themselves. Once bitten twice shy. Users recently had the case where support for indices where lost and it could be that they were making the snapshot on the same device or another device that they thought might also be impacted by a problem (i.e: ransomware). Therefore I believe that it is very important that  early at every step of the backup process  (live indices --> snapshot on first level backup --> snapshot on secondary level backup) to detect any inconsistency as soon as possible and never override data that was initially consistent if the source is not guaranteed to be.
In other words, a stable and consistent backup support at any level of the process should not be taken as a given here and the new procedure should integrante that fact.

A use case that is not covered would be to provide a separate tool like a backup checker that would help to check integrity without having to restore each indices individually (this is the only workaround to my knowledge ). In case of non disponibility of a power enough cluster or simply of any cluster up and running that would probably shorten the recovery time being certain that what you are restoring is not corrupted when a powerful enough cluster will become available.

13243,"FVH works well for my use case, but I've noticed when you have a query string query with wildcards, it doesn't highlight as you would expect.

**Example:**
Create mapping & document:
```
PUT /test/_doc/_mappings
{
    ""_doc"": {
      ""properties"": {
        ""message"": {
          ""type"": ""text"",
          ""term_vector"": ""with_positions_offsets""
        }
      }
    }
}

POST /test/_doc/1
{
    ""message"": ""What dreams may come, when we have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause.""
}
```

Run search:
```
GET /test/_search
{
  ""query"": {
    ""query_string"": {
      ""query"": ""message: \""dreams may come\""""
    }
  },
  ""highlight"": {
    ""fields"": {
      ""message"": {
        ""type"": ""fvh"",
        ""fragment_size"": 40
      }
    }
  },
  ""_source"": false
}
```

Highlight result:
```
""highlight"": {
          ""message"": [
            ""What <em>dreams may come</em>, when we have shuffled""
          ]
}
```
As you can see, the entire phrase is wrapped in my pre and post tags.

But if my query string query includes a wildcard and double quotes to surround the phrase, I get no hits:
```
GET /test/_search
{
  ""version"": true,
  ""query"": {
    ""query_string"": {
      ""query"": ""message: \""dre?ms may come\""""
    }
  },
  ""highlight"": {
    ""fields"": {
      ""message"": {
        ""type"": ""fvh"",
        ""fragment_size"": 40
      }
    }
  },
  ""_source"": false
}
↓
""hits"": {
    ""total"": 0,
    ""max_score"": null,
    ""hits"": []
  }
```

If I wrap the phrase in single quotes, it doesn't highlight the term with a wildcard, and it doesn't even seem to use it to perform the search:
```
GET /test/_search
{
  ""version"": true,
  ""query"": {
    ""query_string"": {
      ""query"": ""message: 'dre?ms may come'""
    }
  },
  ""highlight"": {
    ""fields"": {
      ""message"": {
        ""type"": ""fvh"",
        ""fragment_size"": 40
      }
    }
  },
  ""_source"": false
}
```
or (notice the wildcard is misspelled)
```
GET /test/_search
{
  ""version"": true,
  ""query"": {
    ""query_string"": {
      ""query"": ""message: 'dre?mms may come'""
    }
  },
  ""highlight"": {
    ""fields"": {
      ""message"": {
        ""type"": ""fvh"",
        ""fragment_size"": 40
      }
    }
  },
  ""_source"": false
}
↓
""highlight"": {
          ""message"": [
            ""What dreams <em>may</em> <em>come</em>, when we have shuffled""
          ]
}
```
If there was no quotes around the phrase, the highlight works as expected with a wildcard:
```
GET /test/_search
{
  ""query"": {
    ""query_string"": {
      ""query"": ""message: dre?ms may come""
    }
  },
  ""highlight"": {
    ""fields"": {
      ""message"": {
        ""type"": ""fvh"",
        ""fragment_size"": 40
      }
    }
  },
  ""_source"": false
}
↓
""highlight"": {
          ""message"": [
            ""What <em>dreams</em> <em>may</em> <em>come</em>, when we have shuffled""
          ]
}
```

Edit: I guess wildcard in a phrase in a query string query doesn't work at all. According to this: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html, double quoting for a phrase is the right thing to do.

I don't know if this is the relevant place to comment, but I was having the same problem as using the non fvh highlighter was wrapping terms in a phrase individually as opposed to the entire phrase.

@albertzaharovits The only other messy thing I can think of would be that we don't copy the settings to the `elasticsearch.yml` and instead just pin them in the cluster settings. This would likely also be the first of its kind and it may be too ugly/hard to get working with the way cluster settings work.

1. dynamically change filters using `_cluster/settings`
2. add `dynamic: false` to elasticsearch.yml
3. restart node(s)
4. restrict dynamic changes if at least one node has `false` set

I think we agree here. We've been testing on Java 19 since the EA release builds were out but we haven't done any testing with preview features enabled, primarily because we didn't have any code that leveraged them. So before we would make any real decisions here we'll need to actually test this alternative implementation.

> Elasticsearch has an installer with a prepackaged JDK that is full under your control. Start testing and benchmarking now but give users a chance to test this before next year.

I think what @ChrisHegarty is potentially pushing back against is making this behavior the _default_ in Elasticsearch. There is nothing stopping users from enabling this themselves on a Java 19 runtime.

> The f*king release process of preview APIs is long enough. How long can it take to bring out a feature like this. Wait 5 more years?

I assume this is hyperbole, but no one would argue for such a long incubation period. In fact, I think Elasticsearch has done a pretty good job of staying ahead of the pace here. We made the decision to baseline Elasticsearch 8.0 on Java 17 shortly after it went GA and we have [an open PR](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/90571) to bump the bundled runtime to Java 19 already as well.

So I don't think there's any fundamental reluctance to taking advantage of new language and runtime features. The difference here is that historically we've at least waited for these features to go GA first before enabling them for all users. Perhaps as you say, a feature being ""preview"" is just a matter of semantics, but the point remains that we don't have an precedence here. ",1,1,prediction_comments_elasticsearch.csv

Where I am raising a concern is with the broad impact of enabling preview features JVM-wide **by default**  (this is where we are not in agreement).

We now have a CI job that exercises the new implementation - great.

> Do you have any benchmarks already for comparison. Just for interest to verify my own investigations?

https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/fips-140-compliance.html#_password_hashing

Our docs mention that `cache.hash_algo` should be set to one of the `pbkdf_stretch_*` values in FIPS mode, i.e., _not_ `ssha256`. That'll be mighty slow for a cache... At the same time, the default value we use regardless of whether FIPS is enabled or not is `ssha256`. Changing the default would be a breaking change, especially given the performance implications (default `pbkdf_stretch` runs 10k iterations).

I think it makes the most sense to change the warning check in this PR to also trigger on `ssha256` so we are consistent with our docs but not touch the default setting. Then we can potentially revisit making a breaking change around the setting later. Alternatively, if we deem that `ssha256` _is_ acceptable for in-memory hashing we could update the docs.

删除 自己添加的 /usr/share/elasticsearch/lib/log4j-core-2.16.0.jar 后重启正常。

通过对上述报错与 /usr/share/elasticsearch/lib/ 文件夹分析可知，elasticsearch-7.16.1 （CentOS 使用 yum 安装，并从 7.13.3 升级至 7.16.1）使用 log4j-api-2.11.1.jar，同楼上回复一致。并且 elasticsearch-7.16.1 使用了 elasticsearch-log4j-7.16.1.jar 替换了 log4j-core。

下图是阿里云对 elasticsearch-7.13.3 扫描的结果，仅提示了 log4j-core-2.11.1.jar 存在漏洞，并未说明 log4j-api-2.11.1.jar 是否有问题。

如果大家觉得 log4j-api-2.11.1.jar 可能存在风险，可使用 log4j-api-2.16.0.jar 将其替换（经过测试，暂未发现问题）。

58319,"> I wonder if we should also have some more specific serialization unit tests for the SearchRequest?

We do have somewhat randomized serialization roundtrip testing in SearchRequestTests, also a variation (""testRandomVersionSerialization"") that reads and writes to a stream with a different version setting, but in the later case both versions (for the input and output stream) are the same and also the actual reading/writing logic under test is from the current class under test, so that won't catch all things. I think unit tests are fine but ultimately this is something what mixed cluster were supposed to be for.

> Would that have caught the wire serialization issue that was introduced?

I don't think so. The issue with https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/75745 was that we introduced serialization of a new boolean flag to 7.x but nothing to master, so the PR passed but then tests on master were failing as far as I can recall.

The new functionality lies in extending `EqlFunctionRegistry` to support case insensitive functions which are tagged in the grammar.  In the proper however I've ended up refactoring a bit both the functions and their tests since there was significant repetition between them.
In the process I've changed the case sensitivity parameter from `case sensitive` to `case insensitive` to align it with the underlying ES/Lucene conventions and some inconsistencies since some functions had it one way, others the opposite.
The tests, both integration and unit have been enabled and in the process realized some were simply incorrect so these had to be updated.

The scope of the project of ""auditing security configuration changes"" implies or suggests that auditing is for **objects** (eg roles, users, role mappings, etc, that has changed by some user/key) , whereas our existing audit logs are **subject** based (eg user X modified/deleted role, user, key). To a certain extent you can derive one from the other, to answer different questions, but the devil is in the details.

Referring specifically to your proposal, I think that if we were going to implement a true **object** based audit log, it doesn't make sense to audit change failures, at the very least not by default. But if we build on top of the **subject** based audit log that we've got (as a new field on existing records), then the failed actions become important (to the extent that the default configuration is now **on** from **off**).

I acknowledge the desire for an **object** based audit log, but I got turned off upon seeing both the **subject** (all metadata of the action, less the request body) and the **object** based entries one next to the other; the redundant metadata between the two was glaring and looked unnecessary.

For the moment, I am going to stick with auditing request bodies of access_granted and access_denied events in the existing audit log, within the `request.body` field. I'll try to make this fit into existing configurations of the audit log (avoid hinting to **object** based auditing).

I have some open questions about what it means to output index documents in a log-like file for ECS.

Hope this rambling make sense. Thank you for the valuable input!

Timing :) Yea that's the reason. Not sure how to make it less trappy without making it more complicated. I rather like the idea of the `static` constructors going for the cheapest possible `BytesReference` (we do the same kind of checks elsewhere when constructing as well) rather than making the code that invokes the construction more complicated and handle all those cases?

> I'm also -ε on the hashcode change, unless there's some good evidence that it really saves time.

I'm not sure you'll ever easily be able to benchmark this to save time because the effect is rather indirect. My reasoning simply was that this method is used on the hot path in search (because we use it when looking up from the shard query cache) and it seems kind of pointless to needlessly allocate anything there and waste CPU caches for no benefit at all. That said I'm pretty sure that this one is actually dealt with by escape analysis properly so I'll revert it and let the JVM deal with it :)",1,1,prediction_comments_elasticsearch.csv

93481,"On test-servers this works pretty well in combination with Filebeat and its Elasticsearch-module as we do not have that much traffic there - BUT on our current productive system Filebeat cannot keep up with the mass of auditlogs Elasticsearch is writing. Our ELK then was ddosing itself with logs (Java logs like: `Caused by: java.io.IOException: No space left on device` + the dozens of Java log-lines such logs create) after the system thought there is not enough space left as we hit this https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/master/faq-deleted-files-are-not-freed.html

This gets the whole system into a uber-FUBAR state - Elasticsearch complaining about it cannot write logs, sent via rsyslog to our Logstashes; Elasticsearch writing millions of `data/write`s into audit-logs, which then are scraped by filebeat...

This means that Filebeat is never able to keep up with scraping all needed logs from that audit.json.

We need to be able to filter events **before** they get written to the logfile easily. Also I observed high CPU usage by Filebeat already, only with this meager `processors`:

```
  - drop_event:
      when:
        and:
          - contains:
              log.file.path: ""audit.json""

Only a handful of existing rules < 10 leverage this functionality. Of the ones that do, about half of them could be rewritten to not need it.

The ROI on adding this support is pretty low, but the risk might be hard to measure. I think it's okay to close the issue or de-scope it.

There are some (ugly) workarounds if users want to leverage field <--> field comparisons. Put this expression within a function that can only be evaluated in painless, then that code will never be reached. You could do this:

Makes sense. I think a `400` might be better to signal that it's the caller's fault instead of `404` which can also be observed when a token is simply invalidated and deleted - i.e. the caller did nothing ""wrong"" . Another reason is that Kibana will probably need to treat `404`s as recoverable errors so differentiating on index doesn't exist makes their handling easier too.

I'm not sure. Let's imagine a doc with `content` and `sidebar` sections - the content is the unique stuff, the `sidebar` is your `""About bird flu""` example which has useful word `h5n1` and crappy word `foobar.com`
Significant text (with filtering on) only considers words that survive the de-dup - otherwise we'd tune into the `foobar.com` in the sidebar.  So we'd consider `h5n1` and `avian` from the content.
Let's say the sidebar did not include the word `avian` - that would get a ""true"" background count (assuming there's no other copy-and-paste sidebars bumping up the numbers).
In contrast, the background-count for `h5n1` though, you suspect might need adjustment. Well the only adjustment we can make is the number of documents we saw in the foreground where `h5n1` was in the sidebar but not in the content.  
Implementing that will be challenging - right now filtering happens in the text-analysis phase before we get to the aggregation of terms and counts. This would be increased complexity, response times and RAM cost for what I suspect will be a small increase in usefulness in some cases. There are several other reasons why counts are incorrect and they are all performance trade-offs of this nature.

`:plugins:transport-nio` pulls in `libs:nio` via the runtime configruation, which pulls `:libs:core` according tot [his scan](https://scans.gradle.com/s/vmmgpr3q72uzc/dependencies?focusedDependencyView=dependents&toggled=W1sxXSxbMSwwXSxbMl0sWzIsMF0sWzNdLFs0XSxbNV0sWzZdLFs3XSxbNSwwXSxbNiwwXSxbNywwXSxbMF1d).

`transport-netty4` does not have dependencies to any other libs, like `transport-nio` depends on `:libs:core` thus it won't have this problem. 

The problem is that `:plugins:transport-nio` has a _compile_ dependency on `:libs:core`, but this one is already a dependency of the server, so will be provided when the plugin loads, thus it should be a `compileOnly` dependency. As a consequence of this,  project that depend on `:plugins:transport-nio`, like `:x-pack:plugins:security` will have to have a `compileOnly` dependency on `:libs:nio` or any other transitive dependency of the former for that matter as `compileOnly` doesn't carry transitive dependencies. 

@rjernst
As a side note, while investigating this (and others in the past) I'm constantly puzzled and confused about indirection like this  `org.elasticsearch:elasticsearch-nio:7.0.0-alpha1-SNAPSHOT`. I'm wondering if this is just me ? Why was it done like this ? Should we clean up and always use project dependencies to refer to projects. The example plugins are the only place where I think this makes sense, but we could do that locally.

The documentation is wrong indeed. I'll fix.

> Therefore, based on the absence of the float datatype in that list and the fact that the floating point numbers are being dynamically mapped with a float datatype, it would seem that dynamically mapped floating point numbers cannot be mapped to a double datatype using match_mapping_type.

That part probably needs clarification though I'm not sure how to do it. Basically, the json parser assumes the wider datatype that is not a BigDecimal/BigInteger. So floating-point numbers will be detected as a `double` rather than a `float` and integers will be detected as a `long` rather than an `integer`. You can dynamically map floating-point numbers to doubles by using `double` as a `match_mapping_type` and `double` as a type in the mapping.

> *DISCLAIMER The following is a shameless plug for 64-bit Unsigned Integer support in Elasticsearch
The dynamic mapping to double is needed as there is no support for 64-bit unsigned integers in Elasticsearch, whereas the system publishing the data (a custom Elastic Beat written in Go) does support 64-bit unsigned integers.

This feature has been asked already at #30939, but it has taken some time because most of the needs that were expressed initially couldn't be supported, such as aggregating big decimals. However there seems to be a number of people who seem interested in uint64 support and accept the fact that aggregations would work by dynamically converting them to doubles, which might incur some accuracy loss.",1,1,prediction_comments_elasticsearch.csv

你是根据下面这个文档解决的吗？

https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#configuring-ides-and-running-tests

IntelliJ users can automatically configure their IDE: ./gradlew idea then File->New Project From Existing Sources. Point to the root of the source directory, select Import project from external model->Gradle, enable Use auto-import. In order to run tests directly from IDEA 2017.2 and above, it is required to disable the IDEA run launcher in order to avoid idea_rt.jar causing ""jar hell"". This can be achieved by adding the -Didea.no.launcher=true JVM option. Alternatively, idea.no.launcher=true can be set in the idea.properties file which can be accessed under Help > Edit Custom Properties (this will require a restart of IDEA). For IDEA 2017.3 and above, in addition to the JVM option, you will need to go to Run->Edit Configurations->...->Defaults->JUnit and verify that the Shorten command line setting is set to user-local default: none. You may also need to remove ant-javafx.jar from your classpath if that is reported as a source of jar hell.

To run an instance of elasticsearch from the source code run ./gradlew run

The Elasticsearch codebase makes heavy use of Java asserts and the test runner requires that assertions be enabled within the JVM. This can be accomplished by passing the flag -ea to the JVM on startup.

For IntelliJ, go to Run->Edit Configurations...->Defaults->JUnit->VM options and input -ea.

我也按照上面的步骤执行了。

我安装的 es 版本是 6.3.2(安装在/usr/local/下 )，源码版本也是从github拉的 6.3.2版本的源码，

-Des.path.conf=""/usr/local/elasticsearch-6.3.2/config""
-Dlog4j2.disable.jmx=true
-Didea.no.launcher=true

Currently `ignore_malformed` is a concept or feature that is supported on some types and thats confusing/annoying because we want it for all types to help solve the problem of skipping bad field values.

Some people in #12366 for example have suggested other hack(unofficial) solutions, which might disappear and cause them future problems. It seems to me that `ignore_malformed` with all its nasty reasons exists and should be present on all field types, *if* the user choses to use it.

There are a few other tickets discussing ignore_malformed for other types, and im going to guess they all probably want this feature for all types. I know i do and to try and help ive created another PR for `text` -> https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/29532

I spend some more days thinking about this and I'm still worried that the solution we came up with is too ""messy"":
1. It adds complexity to a place which is already complex - i.e., templates. 
2. When an indexing requests comes and the string in the url doesn't resolve to an index or an alias,  we translate it internally to a create index request where the string is set in the index name. Based on the solution, the master will then resolve the incoming index name parameter first against `match_alias` sections in all template and then will try to resolve it as an index name. This is trappy, so we should an extra parameter to the `CreateIndexRequest` called `indexOrAlias` or some other name (all I can think of sucks). I don't think it's OK to hijack an explicit create index request in a way that will result in an index with another name being created.
3. As stated, there is no guarantee that the index being created will actually end up having the alias that was used to create it. We can of course add that to the logic of ""alias matched"" templates - they should automatically add the alias to the create index.
4. There are still annoying esoteric distributed  race conditions which can result in Bad Things. For example - an esoteric combination of indexing and rollover calls can cause a situation where a node which is behind on it's cluster state processing and didn't learn of the alias can translate an incoming indexing op to a create index request to the master. The master will go through the proposed flow and will create a new index named `apache-logs-00001` (as it doesn't exist due to the rollover) with the `apache-logs-write` added to it. This will cause all indexing to stop as we now have a write alias pointing at two indices. This is maybe fixable by requiring the `indexOrAlias` parameter to be also checked against existing aliases - but that's IMO another messiness in the API.

I still believe that the ""read/write"" aliases is the cleanest solution we had so far but I agree it's a big change and we should all be comfortable with it if we go down that path.

Instead, I would like to suggest another solution. This one is also ""messy"" but at least it is way more contained, enforced by the master, and we can easily remove it when it's not needed. We can add a parameter to the create index api called ""ensureNoExisitngAlias=apache-logs-write"" . The master will check, under the cluster state thread that there is no existing alias with that name before creating the index.  This will allow the beats to allows start by creating the `apache-logs-000001` index (which will succeed or fail with an `ResourceAlreadyExistsException` due to an existing index/alias) and then starting to index.

If you screw up your bashrc to have `JAVA_HOME` point to a different JDK than you intended on using for building ES, you have still screwed up. Also, it's a generic environment variable, so you might change it without thinking about the effects on building ES.

> ... rather than when finding some strange behavior after I upgrade java and end up running with a different java installation than I think I am.

When you upgrade Java, that's hopefully a conscious decision you're making. If the package manager does it automatically for you, then you have to think about the implications. In any case, you cannot avoid having to think about it and you have to manage (maybe multiple) JDK installations on your machine. But that has nothing to do with the existence of a `JAVA_HOME` variable. People manage their JDK installations in many different ways. For example, on my Ubuntu box, I'm using `sudo update-alternatives --config java` to switch between different JDKs, making sure I have the right version in the path. 
I could also put `JAVA_HOME` in my bashrc to point at the latest JDK installation in my path. Some people for example set `JAVA_HOME` as follows in their bashrc:
```
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home`
```
Now when you upgrade your Java installation, your `JAVA_HOME` changes as well and ES gets built with a different JDK installation. Was this my intention when upgrading or not? Maybe, maybe not. Again, the pure existence of `JAVA_HOME` does not help with answering that.

It's definitely an interesting data point given your background and something we should keep in mind in revisiting the messaging here. This is not something that I would expect users to be familiar with, especially as our user base continues to expand. It is a common problem that Java developers face and why there are all sorts of tricks like shading and dependency exclusion, and the primary reason the OSGi effort came in to being. I say this only as additional background, nothing more.

> I am confused. As a user, I received this information. Why deliver a message to a user when you did not intend it?

I'm curious, how did you run into this as a user? A plugin that fails JAR hell really should never make it out the door because it can never have been successfully installed on a cluster while the plugin author was doing local development. It's effectively shipping completely broken code that passes compilation but not any basic integration tests (manual or otherwise).

> This is an implementation detail that doesnt seem relevant to me either as a plugin author nor as Elasticsearch user.

189205,"> I'm curious, how did you run into this as a user?

I am doing an experiment with x-pack-elasticsearch. I added a dependency in build.gradle (tealess) which transitively depends on `netty-all`. Elasticsearch ships with `netty-buffer` and jar-hell triggers at *install time* due to the overlapping java class definitions.

As a developer, I did this, `gradle assemble` and it was successful (no errors). Then, as a user, I installed the plugin and received the ""jar hell"" error.

> A plugin that fails JAR hell really should never make it out the door 

There's no JAR hell check to prevent `gradle assemble` from succeeding, though, so it was easy for me to have this fail.

I think the problem I experience is this:

* As a developer, I can build a plugin successfully that would fail jar-hell check.
* As a user, I can install a plugin that would fail jar-hell check.

Proposal: Can we add a gradle check for this ""jar hell"" thing? This would prevent a plugin from being shipped at all if it fails this check.
Impact: A user will (under normal circumstances) never receive this jar-hell problem.

I think there's perhaps one other edge case that would cause a user to see this jar-hell error, and this is when there are two 3rd party plugins with the same dependency but on two different versions. (say, httpclient 4.5 vs httpclient 4.5.1). I havent' experimented, but I think this would also trigger the jar-hell error for a user who is installing *valid* plugins but creates an invalid scenario with two plugins together creating a jar-hell scenario. To me, this indicates we should improve the error message.

Some light proposals:

* Make `gradle assemble` fail for plugins that would cause jar-hell when loaded in Elasticsearch
* Improve the user messaging to indicate that this is *likely* not the fault of the user, but a problem with the plugin itself or the environment causing such jar-hell. ?",1,1,prediction_comments_elasticsearch.csv
189207,"> This is not elasticsearch specific, it is standard gradle workflow.

I think it is a bug that someone can build an invalid plugin. Citing standard-workflow doesn't do any services to a user (hi!) who is confused by this messaging.

> This is why we do not use transitive dependencies

We have an opportunity to enforce this *in* gradle, do we not? Can we? There seem to be a lot of spoken policies that could be enforced programmatically at build-time.

What I am trying to say is we have tooling that permits invalid plugins to be built and shipped.

> Jar hell is always the fault of the plugin author 

Pointing fingers may be useful, but the message from the exception does *not* point fingers. These things you are telling me can be *in* the message: It's the plugin-author's fault fault, definition of jar hell, transitive dependencies are bad, etc.

You are citing some clear assumptions that make sense to me when you cite them, but our messaging does not cite these assumptions , and our tooling (gradle) does not enforce these assumptions.

I am thankful to be better informed about the policies (no dependencies, assumptions of plugin-author-fault), but I am specifically asking for these assumptions to be announced at the time of the error. If we dislike large error messages, would you accept documentation for this in the Elasticsearch plugin docs *and* a link to it from the error message? 

Notably, googling for ""elasticsearch jar hell"" is full of folks hitting jar hell and asking questions but no definition (From our docs) about what it means and what action to take to resolve it.",1,1,prediction_comments_elasticsearch.csv

I do understand the risks when applying it without due care. However, at the same time there are plenty other ways to screw your data.

Could you please elaborate on ""You will miss documents though, but that is the price we pay for not coordinating refreshes across shards""? Is that in case we delete first?
Also, I'm not sure if I missed a feature in Elasticsearch or you're referring to some script to run outside elasticsearch when you say ""Personally I'd write a script that deletes and indexes each document"". Could you please clarify?

And one more thing, ""folks can always do the _scroll/_bulk process themselves"" assumes physically loading documents to the application and then reindexing them from that application back, did I get that right?

I know it is recommended to delete first, but in order to not lose a single document we can't do that (there are plenty possible failure scenarios that would interrupt indexing documents back). The way our index is set up it is easy to find and delete old copies (that has been accounted for) - the new copies will belong to new parent and both have some identifying information, so it's easy to delete old copies by query.

Yes it doesn't work if you invent new syntax, what works is what's documented. I'll ignore the last part of your comment since I understand your frustration but please note that being aggressive doesn't solve anything ;)

`.tasks` is the index where the info is stored, and the docs are trying to point out that you'll need to delete data from this index at some stage in the future so that it doesn't use too much space. Nowhere does it tell you to do `GET .tasks/task/ID`

`_tasks` is the API and it should be `GET _tasks/Af0W-dC3QQSlJ28uRru0fQ:8488` as you used in the first example, not `GET /_tasks/taskId:8488`.  I can see how these docs could be confusing and will improve that.

Guess what, I too had  to struggle for 2 hours in order to get this new version to try to start. I gave up when I read I had to had root access in order to change most of the settings.

And all I could find for answers  are ""It's for your best interest. We know better than you. "".  I'm sorry, but excuse like that are the reason person are abandoning software for another. We're adult. We can make our own decision of what our development or production need. If I need to only index 20000 documents, I don't need 65535 open files, nor a boosted max_map_count.  

I cannot understand why you could consider that  someone with 10 indices having 4 millions documents per indice  in a 16 nodes per cluster would need the same BASE requirement as someone on a 2 node cluster with 1 indice and 20000 documents. That is ridiculous.

Having our development machine matching YOUR definition of development is totally ignoring the reality of a development team. It remind me of  RHEL 6 having user account limited to 1024 threads in a modern system. Here's it's the opposite: imposing a bare minimum that is way above a logical minimum.

A developer is limited to have localhost only connection? What if I run the development version in a VM that is accessible by multiple developer? What if resource allocated to development machine are lower than production? 

Instead of relying on a unique setup, at the very least, offer us a flag that explicitly start ElasticSearch in Development mode or that tell the bootstrap checker what level of setup this is going to be.

I'm considering giving up and reverting back to 2.1... I'm not really looking forward to call the hosting department for another VM that need to be manually tweaked in order to meet YOUR arbitrary decided minimum requirement.

I've been pushing Elastic Search  over SOLR at the various development team because it was easy t use, fully self contained and reliable.  Now, with version 5 and the direction the development team is taking, I'm not so sure.

So do consider making those test optional. No setup are the same and telling us that everyone need the same minimum as if they were running an industrial index is totally being blind.

2) I would love to see the new ""highest time stamp seen from retry requests"" state of the engine added to the engine stats. I can see how this would help us debug future issues where node clocks are way of sync and some network hickup causes the engine to be hours in non-optimized mode. I think it will be very hard to debug otherwise. 
3) I would love it if we can push as much of the logic as possible into the engine. Right now the canHaveDuplicate property of `IndexRequest` has a relationship with autoGenId. I would prefer if we change IndexRequest to have simple flags like ""autoGenId"" and ""isRetry"" (or isReplay) and let the engine draw its conclusions from that. I think it make the logic all in one place, making a hairy change easier.
4) I think it will be good to have an independent integration test that indexes in append only mode concurrently (with relocations and potentially with network partitions) and check the end result is good. Thinking about the past issues we had with this optimization, it's very likely that all components behave as expected but things still go wrong in subtle ways when they work together.

I feel folks should be happily surprised that painless is there instead of having pain due to too fast moving. It really costs us nothing but a couple of bytes in the zip file. If I'd upgrade with scripts in an index or a file. I'd first get the upgrade done then work on my scripts to cut over to painless. Painless is such a beautiful addition I really don't want to move to fast to hide the joy it should bring to the user by angry issues from users that required the BWC.

It is simply a critical statement: its important we accept that the codebase is a big disorganized mess!

@clintongormley I am sorry if you want to live in a fantasyland where people only make positive comments, but that is not going to happen. Say hello to your reality check.

The problem is, the packages and the layout go hand in hand, and both contribute to making abnormally long file names:
- `src/main/java` can be `src/java`
- `src/main/resources` can be `src/resources`
- `src/test/java` can be `src/test`
- `src/test/resources` can be `src/test-resources`

The packaging starts with the abnormally long `org.elasticsearch` which could easy be `org.elastic` or something better, but it doesnt end there. It sometimes goes to hierarchies 6 or 7 deep, which is totally unnecessary. More than 99% of these hierarchies are undocumented.

That is a disorganized mess, and it makes super long file names which cause problems with e.g. copy-paste, overflowing terminals, all kinds of stuff. Tab completion or fancy IDEs does not fix the problem.

So yea, I'm sorry to have to be the one to say, that this is crap, but its crap. I will repeatedly emphasize this because it is the reality. It is not bullying.

The problem is caused by the fact that one the node has been restarted, it doesn't find any cluster state in it's data folder and thinks all indices are gone:

It's a bit weird also that you do have `_state` folders and files. When ES deletes indices it will delete all the folder as well.

Dude...

Hello, the fact that ES 5.x `org.elasticsearch.client` transport artifact explicitly expects log4j2 2.7 made things quite hard for us. I don't understand the exact reason it's not using the slf4j API. Using `log4j-over-slf4j` is not an option since there will very likely be `log4j-slf4j-impl` in the class path to process the logs of ""standard"" libraries that don't make an explicit choice about the logging framework.

Our particular - not so fancy - use case:
We use the ES 5.x client in the code for a Storm topology. The Storm distribution packs log4j2 2.1 -  which is on the class path of all Storm processes on the cluster. ES client is not content with that version due to some new log4j2 API changes I guess so what are the options:

- replace all log4j2 2.1 jars on the Storm cluster with 2.7
- attempt to roll a shaded *.jar which packs log4j2 2.7 with relocation of `org.apache.logging.log4j`moved to different location, `META-INF/log4j-provider.properties` updated to point at that new location, etc., etc. - spent half a day on it, still not working!

I agree, my explanation is misleading, sorry. This is all my brain was able to produce in English after having spent so much time debugging ec2/s3 stuff.

I pointed to Jackson's because the stacktrace in #18539  shows that `ClassUtil.checkAndFixAccess()` method throws the exception when it tries to call `setAccessible(true)` on a public constructor without even checking the modifiers first, which seemed strange to me. Since the AWS `Partitions` class looked good to me (I also suspected a missing `public` on ctor or setter... did I miss something?) I suspected that Jackson's should check the modifiers first like it does [in more recent versions](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/master/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/util/ClassUtil.java#L864-L865).

I stopped there, hoping that a more recent version of AWS SDK will use a more recent version of Jackon Databinding that has more checks and options to configure object bindings.

I agree, I updated my comment. Thanks for your feedback, please let me know if that's better now.

That was my first guess too but I think now that the issue can only be fixed with an update of the version of Jackson used by AWS SDK + a better configuration of Jackson's object mapper used by AWS SDK (like disabling MapperFeature.CAN_OVERRIDE_ACCESS_MODIFIERS / OVERRIDE_PUBLIC_ACCESS_MODIFIERS / ALLOW_FINAL_FIELDS_AS_MUTATORS). So many things just to load a JSON config file...

I'll create an issue in the aws sdk java GitHub repository to track this.

1. better option than new RAMDirectory(FSDirectory) for folks that want to load the entire index into RAM.

2. more efficient warming than e.g. running a bunch of queries or other things. This could be a concern for those random access datastructures, I agree.

It will touch the first byte of every page. This is still useful as it knows platform-specific crap like page size to do this. Additionally, on linux, before it does that touching, it will call madvise(WILL_NEED).

I'm not sure if we should do this by default: its a fairly serious hammer? Basically you are saying ""I think i know better than the operating system"" by using this.

But we could work on things like method augmentation.  Imagine giving CharSequence a few of the ones it has in groovy (http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/groovy-jdk/java/lang/CharSequence.html#findAll%28java.util.regex.Pattern%29)

so e.g. `""foobar"".findAll(/something/)` would return a list. They have others.

I am not saying we should do this, it needs a lot of thought, .e.g i dont want to maintain tons of shitty string functions either, at the sametime distrustful of groovy code that e.g. adds an `execute` method to List and other horrible things they do. Nor do I really want to do our own thing and document any kind of ""api"", maybe just a key subset (e.g. regex and similar features on CharSequence)...

Just something to think about, it avoids the downsides of performance tradeoffs and confusion due to operator explosion.

+1 for that and thanks for cleaning up the PR. Looks much better to me.

I agree with @nik9000 and @rmuir: Users that really want to use the Matcher object should simply call `.matcher()` on the pattern. If they need a matcher they will also want to get the groups and so on. In that case a simple syntax using `~=` is contraprocuctive, because them people tend to do horrible shit like `('a'=~/foo/).group(n)` over and over for every group. With having to call matcher they see that there is actually some object returned that can be stored and then group() called on the local stored matcher.

A second thing: If the pattern is bullshit, you would only see this in a clinit error. Maybe you should pass the Pattern to Pattern.compile also as a compile-time check (just to try if it compiles).

Another question: How to handle pattern arguments like caseinsensitive? currently you have to pass as ""(?i)"" as part of the regex. PERL users know this as coming after the second slash, e.g. `/regex/i`

I was hoping to do that in a followup, but, yes, I think we should hadn't flags after the trailing `/`.

> I'm wondering if we can use modes instead of custom code for the regexes in the lexer.

I investigated that. We can do it but it makes the lexer much more complex to read though probably simpler to run. Because modes don't inherit from each other you'd need to copy every rule and rename it. It pretty much quadruples the size of the lexer because you need to specify every mode transition and most token's types. Twice.

Not exactly, we need one bitset per slice that's true but not all at the same time. Each slice is independent and it would be nuts to query them all in parallel. You could for instance split your query in 10,000 slices and use 4 threads/workers to process the scrolls (that would be 4 bitsets in the heap at a given time). Each scroll corresponds to one slice and each bitset can be trashed when the corresponding scroll is exhausted. The memory explosion could happen only if you send thousands of slice queries in parallel which I repeat would be ineffective.

The option is in the Client API, accessible through `IndicesStatsRequest.detailedSegmentsStats(boolean)`, so also through `NodesStatsRequest.indices`. 

Currently it can be requested through HTTP in `RestIndicesStatsAction` and `RestNodesStatsAction`, but it's kinda ugly, just checks if the key `detailed_segments` is in the query string. Maybe leave the option only in the Client API by now?

It's possible to do that, but it's kind of weird.

When adding a new field:

```
If the field name contains dots (eg `foo.bar.baz`):
    Does the first part of the field (`foo`) exist as a field in the mapping already?
        If yes: conflict
        If no: add field as `foo.bar.baz`
Else (field name does not contain dots, eg `foo`)
    Do any fields exist in the mapping which start with `foo.`?
        If yes: conflict
        If no:  add field as `foo`
```

This logic would prevent conflicting paths from being added.

When looking up a field (eg `foo.bar.baz`) in search/aggs etc:

```
Does `foo` exist?
Does `foo.bar` exist?
Does `foo.bar.baz` exist?
```

229707,"> On the other hand, if we just want an optimized way to encode a double, but with some restraints on range/precision, that e.g. takes advantage of things like GCD compression already implemented in docvalues, then maybe we treat it just like that, and figure out an alternative name?

Yeah, this was my goal personally.  I just want better compression for when you don't need the fully dynamic range of doubles.  I even have a big, fat warning in the docs that this is not equivalent to `Decimal` and similar currency types, since it always casts back to Double for arithmetic.  Just a storage optimization really.

++ to renaming to something more clear, I have no attachment to `fixed`. :)  Random ideas:
- `variable_precision`: to illustrate that you can change the precision. But it sounds like each value may have its own precision or something
- `real_storage`: e.g. real-valued number optimized for storage (yuck)
- `truncated_real`: e.g. real-valued with truncated precision
- `compressed_real`, `compressed_float`
- `scaled_real`, `scaled_float`

I dunno, those are all terrible. 

@jpountz: Not sure I understand.  Do you mean to pick a scale that provides, say, 6 digits of sigfigs and simply use that?  I think that's fine on the fractional side of things (since Lucene will compress down unused bits), but it arbitrarily limits the range for not much change in complexity?  Maybe i'm misunderstanding?

229801,"@jprante, thanks for all the pointers!  I spent some time searching closed issues but didn't manage to find those.  The context is very helpful, I didn't realize the history that I was stumbling into and it's helpful in understanding where everyone is coming from and why the discussion is so heated!

@dadoonet, thanks for clarifying the use case!

@clintongormley, w/r/t your first suggestion, I'll look into that.  As @dadoonet alluded to, the mechanics of doing that are very cumbersome.  But I'm gathering that it's the only ""officially supported"" mechanism?

@clintongormley, if one were to switch from a client node to a transport node aren't there important functional ramifications in turns of ""smart load balancing"" etc that are being lost?

@clintongormley, @jprant, @dadoonet, (the yuckiness of pushing internal ES details into my app aside), is the ""extend a Node"" hack fundamentally broken?  And apologies if that's already discussed in one of the links, I'm still working through the discussions.

I realize you all are very deep into the 2.X series but for someone who is just coming at it and upgrading from 1.7 to 2.X, the ""right thing"" to do in this situation is _very opaque_.  As a user of ES, I'm very motivated to do the right thing, I'm just still working through what that is/how to do it!  So, a strong +1 for providing guidance on what the right thing is and a strong +1 for making it practical to do the right thing.  Of all the breaking changes in 2.X that we're dealing with, this is the one that's the least documented and that I'm spending the most time on.  I realize that it's only a subset of users so (understandably) not a top priority but for anyone who is in this situation, it's painful.

Only dodgy code which tries to scrape the classpath for jar files and then open each one directly would fail in such a scenario.

Using InetAddress is not a good solution, it will result in memory leaks (we must assume each host is cached infinitely). In general with any massive use of DNS (via InetAddress, JNDI, etc) we have to worry about craziness like exhaustion of entropy on the machine (securerandom is used for DNS port randomization to ""help"" address spoofing), bogus data (e.g. NXDOMAIN hijacking), tons of network traffic, throttling, triggering alarms, etc.

I am aware that doing DNS operations on millions of log records, etc is sometimes something people want.

231609,"Thanks costin, ryan and I continued with your branch, he did some cleanup on dependencies, I am basically trying to help with the integration test and getting this working on unix systems.

The things resolved so far are:
1. Hadoop jars were added one by one, only the most minimal set with no transitive dependencies. this way we can get this thing working without jar hell etc and minimize the surface area. It is now up to ConnectException so I think its fairly close. 
2. Hadoop will not work at all on non-windows systems without full execute permission across the entire filesystem (https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/branch-2.7.1/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/util/Shell.java#L381-L402). This is obviously unacceptable, I had to add a brutal hack to deliver a custom IOException from our security code (instead of SecurityException) when it tries to do this. This needs to ultimately be fixed in hadoop.
3. Hadoop needs `jaas_unix` loadLibrary permission or it fails with security exception (because only `jaas_nt` is added right now.

See in-progress changes here: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/compare/master...rjernst:hdfs_without_transitive

One thing we have right now is a bug in our handling of slf4j which affects hadoop. We don't actually ship it in any ES distributions, yet the build treats it as `provided`, so its also not in any plugin that wants it. I hacked around this temporarily, but that needs to be sorted out.

And if even if a duplicate was used and the ""wrong"" class was loaded isn't it a case of caveat emptor (""let the buyer beware"" ) ?

I think 2 years ago I would have agreed with you. Now after all the things that i have seen working on es core for a long time I can tell you any kind of opt-out and or leniency is the root of all evil. The only thing that I am considering as a temporary solution until we have a good and released test-fixture for a real integ test is to add an opt-out to the jar hell check in the test bootstrap.

236076,"Update: I believe I addressed all comments.

As mentioned above I found the parameter renaming issues @cbuescher found scary enough to go through the json query dsl reference guide, parse the examples therein into a separate test class to see if everything remains parseable:

https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/14249/files#diff-2528bf3a5b01f96751f6fed1ee8f8189R26

No surprise: There were a few typos in the docs as well as a few things that are documented but do not work. However I also found another parameter name that I incidentally renamed. 

To me that's another argument to add more tests to the suite that start with the json representation of the query. However the class linked above looks ugly enough to me that I'd like to throw it away rather sooner than later. For illustration I moved one of the dsl reference guide example queries from above over to the corresponding unit test here:

https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/14249/files#diff-262a49e710e2ff18f41b578be2e0fdf7R250

(essentially copying the approach taken here: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/09d2b4130003191631857d5b8a59c22c84ea8fbb/core/src/test/java/org/elasticsearch/index/query/HasChildQueryBuilderTests.java#L200 )

Caveat: Though the change is simple enough for each query, doing it for all will take more than five minutes. So a second look confirming that this is really where we want to go is highly welcome.

> @nickminutello Is this with a custom plugin that uses its own exceptions?

I don't think so - if I had to guess I'd say its just an exception we didn't test well. IIRC in 2.0 exception passing is done differently so the unserializable exception is probably exclusive to 1.7.

Im' not 100% sure on the root cause. I guess it could be a jar hell thing - I've not looked into the full story of equals and hashcode for package and class objects but if it was easy to do we'd have seen it in testing or production somewhere else. 

So I'm not sure. What does the environment look like where you run this? Do you modify the white and black lists? If so, what do you have them set to?

237897,"Hi,
Ryan was talking with me about this as I am the ""Apache Guy"". I wrote the gradle plugin for forbiddenapis, released yesterday as version 2.0. I also investigated using the gradle wrapper to test the plugin in an gradle environment (the build of forbiddenapis is ANT and that is fine for multi-build-system plugin: we have Ant, Maven, Gradle, CLI in forbiddenapis and bugs like gradleApi() introducing tons of bullshit into your compile environment, including incomaptible ASM versions stopped me from migrating the whole build to gradle - so gradle not always have good sides). The most horrible thing is: You cannot get Gradle and all its internal dependencies on Maven Central! I have no idea why this is like that, but this makes developing plugins a pain, unless you use Gradle to build your plugin with gradleApi() f*cking up your classpath,

While reviewing Gradle wrapper to have an easy test environment for the plugin, I just noticed the following problems: In Lucene and Solr we are not allowed to put JAR files into source distributions or commit them to SVN. There are checks of the download archives regularily that enforce this. This was a big issue before Lucene's build moved to Ant/Ivy, because we also had compile time dependencies committed to SVN, and this was a blocker at some point! On top of that: Recently Groovy got into Apache Incubation as it wants to join as a full fledged ASF project. One of the first commits after importing the Git repo into ASF was - you might guess it - removing the wrapper jar and wrapper scripts (see https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-groovy-notifications/201505.mbox/%3Cc28c218e8f694efbaa5fa774ceb26b72@git.apache.org%3E). In the meantine they seem to had some discussions (also on the legal forums) and I think it was added back as a ""special case"", but having binary files in a source distrbution is still a no-go.

Here was the discussion: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/groovy-dev/201504.mbox/%3C552F3B8F.6030207@gmx.org%3E

Other Apache projects use custom shell scripts to download the gradle wrapper. It would all be simple if the gradle wrapper would be deployed to Maven central, but it isn't. In Lucene we have similar code that downloads the IVY version to use with Ant using ""ant ivy-bootstrap"".

As Elasticsearch is no ASF project, the situation might be different here, but my personal opinion is also: Don't do this! The Gradle people want to push you to this, but this is not real open-source like (you know there is a company behind, looks like they want to push their binary into every source repo).

I don't see a problem requiring a Gradle installation to build Elasticsearch. Where is the difference to Maven or Ant required to build a project?

As a plugin author, I can not ""setup things properly"" because this would require me to know target server's list of plugins at my plugin compile time. In other words, it is impossible for a plugin author to make their plugin compatible with all existing and all future plugins.

Currently we use a hack, a huge block size (60KB vs 16KB) to allow this algorithm to compress better within the confines of the current format.

But what is really needed for it to kick ass is to have shared dictionary support. Its just nontrivial to have both shared dictionary support _and_ bulk merging without recompression _and_ low memory overhead _and_ good performance and all this shit that people want.

Also the java apis around deflate dictionaries are weak: you don't have access to the current compression dictionary like the trick used for http://zlib.net/pigz/ or any of that: so I wouldnt be surprised if the algorithm was changed to something else in the future.

239639,"> Then the master goes off and does allocation and such, and fails.

Small correction - the master doesn't fail to allocate (typically), but rather the node that receives the cluster state and goes and allocates the shard fails in creating it and notifies the master about it. This is where the asynchronicity  comes from.

> it seems like there the cluster health with waitFor request should fail once it is impossible to reach that state

This is trickier than it seems - how do you define that it is impossible to reach a state in  30s? maybe there is a network hick up that caused a node to drop off the cluster and it will be back? Maybe , like in our tests, we are busy forming a cluster and the nodes will join in 10 seconds?

The problem with this issue is we currently don't keep track of all the places we tried to create a shard and it failed. The master sees the shard fails message from a node, and tries another. If that fails it may go back to the first one. If you only have one node, the master will first clean the shard by sending the node a state where the shard is not assigned to it and then will try again. We should find a place to keep track of this and be able to say ""we tried all options so far, so no point in trying again"".  Perhaps the new unassigned info can be extended to keep ""tried and failed"" node list, which will be cleared upon successful allocation (because unassigned info goes away) and will be used to stop this infinite loop.

The java client is really an elasticsaerch node (lightweight) even if you use the transport ""client"". What others have build is a custom REST interface tailored to their domain such that they can talk to different version of the cluster etc. I am not saying that is what you should do but there is no other way than replacing the java client with the new version and the new java client we are working on is not going to help for 1.x to 2.x - or lets say very very unlikely

Additionally we spent lots of time, and added lots of paranoia in lucene to actually help with shitty behavior from shared filesystems, so it would be nice if it stands a chance.

I get above strange errors and it is due to this line https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/plugins/PluginsService.java#L358
.
These errors appeared strange because a week ago I checkedout code
and it just worked amazingly as expected .. but I don't know what happened all of  sudden.
so I just wanted to check if I can proceed if I bypass the error by commenting that line.
but I then landed up in this exact error which someone else too caught ..pls see this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30837055/elastic-search-error .

ok some things is strange .... 
if this is so strange and it is not worth going further in this direction, at least tell me how you guys debug elastic search code in eclipse.
I can set a debug point by doing a remote debug in eclipse. for that I need to run elastic search in debug mode. But I don't know where it is to set the debug = yes and port on which to java vm runs so that I can add that port to eclipse ... I searched in config too ..
can you point me to some docs or wiki . That would be great help ..

I don't know `SpawnShittyModules`... can't find it... but if you do, please go ahead and remove it (it sounds like...hmmm... a shitty class)

This issue however is about `SpawnModules` and its contract is as simple as ""a module that spawns other modules""... one could have named it `CompoundModule` which is a module that is made out of other modules, but that's not the case... the name is `SpawnModules`. Would have been nice if this would be ingrained in the `AbstractModule` class, but it isn't. Guice's `AbstractModule#install` method comes close, but it is meant to be used within the `configure` method. The `SpawnModules` enables adding its sub-modules before the injector is created and therefore works well with the `PreProcessModule` construct.

If you want to remove it, sure... go ahead, but at the same time provide a good alternative that doesn't force a single place in the code knowing about all the services in the codebase(s). In other words, If modules `A` depends on `a1` and `a2` modules, and `a1` defines an internal service `s1`, there's not reason for `A` to directly know about `s1`\- it's an implementation detail of `a1` and `a1` only.

And if you do provide an alternative that enables same level of modularity, that'd be awesome.  But then it's a cleanup as it doesn't really fix any bugs, and therefore I don't see any reason for it to be a blocker for beta1. The referenced bug in this issue has nothing to do with the sole existence of `SpawnModules` class. It's an implementation bug that can be implemented with or without this class (if you load classes by names from settings, you're bound to hit it, regardless of where you do it)

The problem is, they are different data structures (it is like trie versus tree, but the difference is important).

The terms dictionary is optimized for lookup by ""String"", but the docvalues dictionary is optimized for lookup by ordinal.

The docvalues lookup by term is much slower than the postings one, because its not optimized for that. The inverse is true for lookup by ordinal: the entire datastructure is built around doing this with as little overhead as possible: it can do random access within a block, etc. 

Given that even a vint for prefix/suffix length is too costly for that case, I don't think we should introduce a branch per-byte with something like n-gram compression. I have run the numbers for that on several datasets (real data: not artificial crap like IDs) and it only saves something like 25% space for that datastructure, depending on the text: in many cases lower than that.

Its important to keep seek-by-ord fast at the moment, because too much code uses sorted/sorted_set docvalues in an abusive fashion with a seek-by-ord for every document, to lookup the text. Elasticsearch has gotten a little better by incorporating things like global ordinals, but it still has bad guys like its scripting support. There are similar cases for other lucene users and even in some lucene modules itself. Historically, people wrote code expecting this to be ""ok"" and ""fast"" with fieldcache/fielddata, because that did no compression at all: not even prefix compression. A lot of this code was just ported to docvalues without addressing this, so we still have to keep it fast.

246460,"Finally an issue worth discussing :)

I think we should have so-called ""strict"" boolean parsing, because we can assume what we are doing is actually important. When things aren't important e.g. `do you want another beer?`, then lenient parsing of booleans is just fine: you can default to `true` and nothing will go wrong!

So the context is critical: here we are talking about situations such as parameter configuration for a distributed system that might hold terabytes of data, and input parameters to APIs that might be connected to even larger systems doing god knows what.

This is just the assumption you must make with code: in general computers are used for important things these days, so that's why I think everyone should use boolean parsing that doesn't suck. 

Let's just make this clear and unambiguous to prevent problems: it's easy!

> Today, most boolean settings in Elasticsearch are parsed leniently
> using Booleans.parseBoolean, which interprets 0, no, off and false
> as false, else true for any random strings like NO or OFF or foobar, etc.

Terrible

> I think this is dangerous: if the user has a typo for false, or maybe
> thinks ""disabled"" would also mean false, they silently get true.

Its dangerous for a ton of other reasons too, for example its inconsistent with java's equally crappy `Boolean.parseBoolean` which instead maps unknown values to `false`. This is just asking for bugs.

> There are languages, such as Perl, which don't have boolean values. This is the reason that boolean parsing in Elasticsearch is lenient.

Perl has the worst boolean semantics on the planet:

```
The number 0, the strings '0' and '', the empty list ""()"", and ""undef""
are all false in a boolean context. All other values are true.
Negation of a true value by ""!"" or ""not"" returns a special false
value. When evaluated as a string it is treated as '', but as a 
number, it is treated as 0.
```

Somehow they managed to actually make it worse than C. 

This doesn't mean we should map all non-zero numbers to `true`, or do other crazy things because of language X or Y or Z. Seriously, why can't we just supply simple unambiguous interfaces and let the Perl language client deal with making it ""perl-like"" on the client-side? That's its job.

Trying to do this stuff server-side just begs for complexity and bugs. Which numbers are acceptable? Maybe we should apply unicode normalization so that full-width numbers work? What about ideographic numbers? We can bring in ICU to parse chinese numbers. Some writing systems might not have a concept of zero, what to do there? 

Screw that. In most cases we expect these configuration values to be important, and the API to be used as an important interface for the application. Communication here should be clear, simple, and unambiguous. We can do this, and just transcend the language problem the same way we'd solve this in the physical world. What is the best way there? Something like this works surprisingly well:

```
Nod your head for `yes`, shake for `no`, anything else and I'll punch you in the face.
```

We can translate that directly into java code, by parsing ""true"" to `true` and ""false"" to `false`, with anything else as an exception. In Java, its important declare a checked exception like `ParseException` too, so that you inform the caller of the ""rules"", and so that the flow of their code is forced to deal with the exceptional case. I generally hate checked exceptions like anyone else, but when used sparingly as a tool to prevent bugs, they do have their place.

> I believe that no, yes, on, off, etc are supported because of the YAML spec: http://yaml.org/type/bool.html

This doesn't mean we have to allow them. There are other things in the YAML spec we may not allow too. This isn't inconsistent, its the same as YAML only allowing certain whitespace characters, despite requiring a Unicode text encoding. They don't have to allow all Unicode whitespace just because Unicode defines whitespace in a certain way.

If we think the boolean settings being parsed are all unimportant, then by all means, stick with a crappy lenient parser. Otherwise we should really fix this everywhere.

247708,"The problem here is that on Elasticsearch startup the big builder is initializing a lot of shit in a unforseeable order, and concurrent in addition. The main problem here is that the Codec/Postingsformat/... stuff has a large spaghetti of load-time dependencies, so if called in the wrong order concurrently, it hangs.

To solve the issue here, my suggestion is to simply call those static initializes at a defined place in Elasticsearch's bootstrap, so it cannot happen that index A is initialized at the same time while index B is also booting up and both are loading SimpleText codec and ElasticsearchFooBar codec in parallel.

We can then look into Lucene's code to cleanup the loading of codecs. The big problem is the dependency graph and static initializers. The main problem is the Codec.getDefault() value that is initialized with Codec.forName(). I think the problem would be much easier if we would just initialize the default codec with a simple new LuceneXYCodec() instead of SPI on the <clinit> phase. Currently we have code like ""static Codec defaultCodec = forName(""Lucene50"");""

So two steps:
- prevent deadlocks in ES caused by Lucene for now by explicitely initializing Codec class in Bootstrap.java
- change Lucene's Codec/PostingsFormat to initialize the default codecs/formats without forName(), because this can lead to deadlock. Just use a simple ""new"" call to constructor.

Similar propblems are regularirly happening in ICU4J: You remember the case where ICU4J caused NullPointerExceptions because it was trying to print a message using the default codec before the default codec was actually loaded and initialized... The problems in Lucene are the same, just happening in multithreaded code.

Actually I am glad that I repaired the LockFactory shit last September for Lucene 5 :-) The LockFactory has no initialization anymore, it is a singleton. But the actual makeLock call passes the directory, so we are sure that everything fits each other!

But I agree, we should do the tests just before we do the mkdirs() with the already fully resolved path.

Without a doubt, having both is silliness. So we should be looking at what is really needed and what is the simplest solution.

_Not_ what is the most flexible solution
_Not_ what is the most user friendly solution

But what keeps the codebase smallest and easiest to maintain.

Definitely having both this and #11362 is a huge no-go, we don't need so many ways to do the same thing.

This is the wrong place in our codebase to have unnecessary complexity. Configuration today is already crazy? no.... ABSOLUTELY BONKERS with its reading of environment variables, sysprops, you name it.

Again my problem is not this PR in particular, and sorry @javanna for the comments ending up here, but they gotta go somewhere, we need to sort out what we want to do and not add lots of config options that then nobody will ever remove for back compat reasons.

  posIncAttribute.setPositionIncrement(1); // thats bogus

252136,"Hi Simon,

I guess I used to much 'I need support' trigger words?

My issue was: holy crap, ES is dropping indices after a restart of a single node. This sounds like a bug right?

Anyways I've done some more digging and think I have found something interesting for you. It seems that the dangling indices got deleted by curator. Some 7 hours later one node got restarted and the deleted indices reappeared, but without data, so cluster got red. Thats a bug to me.

Lets take one of those dangling indices as example: logstash-xpr-apache-2015.02.26

Here is what happens:
- curator deletes it at Mar 12th 04:05
- 1 node is restarted and upon startup at Mar 12th 11:49 it detected a dangling index
- the master auto-imports it at Mar 12th 11:49
- cluster got red, because the dangling indices did not have a primary or replica available
- curator deletes it (again) at Mar 13th 04:07
- cluster goes green

So on 1st DELETE did work only half: data got removed, but index stayed in local metadata on 001.

Raw logs:

```

1. If you specify `analyzer` you can't specify `index_analyzer`, `search_analyzer` or `search_quote_analyzer` as well. Doing so will throw a parse exception
2. You must specify `index_analyzer` and `search_analyzer` together or we throw a parse exception
3. If you specify `search_quote_analyzer` you must specify `search_analyzer` (and because of 2. you must also specify `index_analyzer`) or we throw a parse exception

Thinking about it, I don't think it's a good idea to let people set either `search_analyzer` or `index_analyzer` to the default analyzer since you need to be careful about these settings and don't want an unexpected change to the default analyzer to screw up these settings.

Just think about it: if the synonyms don't go through the same output processing,
then they are useless 
```

Not always. In a normalization rule the output term doesn't have to be anything other than a single indexed token that represents a common concept mapped to various forms of end-user expressions e.g.

```
i pod, i-pod, mp3 player => SKU_3672
```

Here, end users will not search for SKU_3672 directly - tokenization in this case would be irrelevant and unhelpful.

The alternative use case is an expansion rule where we have 2 use cases - 
1) Index-time expansion of document terms (anticipating future user searches)
2) Query-time expansion of user search criteria

In the case of 1) Mike's blog is relevant and talks about introducing false positives in searches. I note the offsets in my GIST look screwed too so highlighting accuracy might be a concern [1] we need to fix here.
Given these issues and the general inflexibility of the index-time approach an end user might just as well consider using a normalization rule here?

In the case of 2) we can benefit from increased matching capabilities on previously untreated content but I wonder if these outputs are better expressed as actual query expressions if that is their intention? That brings the possibility of adding NOTs etc to the definition.

I wonder how bad it is to run with the wrong version (i.e., too old in this case). Wouldn't that cause way more subtle exceptions?  I see things around field data and analysis.  

If we are concerned about this maybe we should have a work around cluster level settings which assigns a version instead of throwing an exception. We can potentially only do it in 1.x.

Alternatively, it's also possible to wrap any Query and ""spy on"" the communication between the consumer (IndexWriter in this case) and that query, to see all docIDs that were visited; this way we could continue to use IW's more efficient delete-by-Query, but gather up all docIDs that were in fact deleted.  But this is a more hairy/evil/complex solution... though I think Solr already has something doing this.

2. somehow collect a list of _all_ possible values of a context and send the entire list with _every_ request to `/_suggest`.

In some cases it will create a mess and in some no. In the case I outlined above it works better for me than trying to combine several flavors of _all like field (stemmed and unstemmed) and it is the only way to have an _all like field combining stemmed and unstemmed input very importand for cases where stemming of certain contributing fileds can screw up data (like stemming people names)

in cases when you have hundreds of fields contributing to an _all like field I would like to have as much control over how it is put together (boosts, position gaps and analyzer chain) as possible. It would be up to me to make sure it is not mess in the end. I would not want ES preventing me from getting burned by denying me such functionality. Not to mention that there could be many people who do use it already and removing it would break their code. 

I do not dispute that _all like field level analyzer chain without per contributing field chains is the most common use case but why not use shorthand default config - absence of analyzers on contributing field definition which will be the case when using your shorthand version as indication that the _all like field analyzers should be used

274355,"So we have `PUT/POST`, `GET` and `DELETE` for all three we have several options. I list some here again. Please feel free to add your own option and vote.

I vote for 

`PUT/POST`: Option 1

`GET`: Option 2

`DELETE`: Option 1

## `PUT/POST`:

### Option 1:

Remove all singular `PUT`s, do not distinguish between `PUT` and `POST` and only allow putting multiple items for all 4 APIs like this:

```
   POST (or PUT) /index/_mappings|_settings|_warmers|_aliases
   { name: {....}, name2: {....} ... }
```

The `PUT` like

```
 PUT /index/_alias|_warmer/{name}
```

would be removed completely. This might cause some overhead when typing requests but at least you can remember the syntax even when you are braindead.

### Option 2:

Make the distinction singular/plural (`PUT/POST`) like @clintongormley wrote:

```
 PUT /index/_mapping|_alias|_warmer/{name}
 { ... }

 POST /index/_mappings|_settings|_warmers|_aliases
 { name: {....}, name2: {....} ... }
```

This would cause the syntax to be slightly more complex but is still sort of intuitive.

### Option 3:

Like option 2 but allow singlar and plural for `PUT` and `POST`. Would not break bwc.

## `GET`

### Option 1

allow plural and singular but only `GET /index/_api/{name|*|_all|blank}`

```
 GET /index/_mapping|_alias|_warmer|_setting/{name|*|_all|blank}
 GET /index/_mappings|_aliases|_warmers|_settings/{name|*|_all|blank}
```

### Option 2

allow only plural

```
GET /index/_mappings|_aliases|_warmers|_settings/{name|*|_all|blank}
```

### Option 3

allow plural and singular with `GET /index/_api/{name|*|_all|blank}` and `GET /index/{name|*|_all|blank}/_api`

```
 GET /index/_mapping|_alias|_warmer|_setting/{name|*|_all|blank}
 GET /index/_mappings|_aliases|_warmers|_settings/{name|*|_all|blank}

 GET /index/{name|*|_all|blank}/_mapping|_alias|_warmer|_setting
 GET /index/{name|*|_all|blank}/_mappings|_aliases|_warmers|_settings
```

Would not break bwc.

### Option 4

allow only plural

```
GET /index/_mappings|_aliases|_warmers|_settings/{name|*|_all|blank}
GET /index/{name|*|_all|blank}/_mappings|_aliases|_warmers|_settings
```

## `DELETE`

### Option 1

Make the `DELETE` available for 3 APIs like in `_warmer`:

```
 DELETE index/_mapping|_alias|_warmer/name

 DELETE index/_mapping|_alias|_warmer/prefix*

 DELETE index/_mapping|_alias|_warmer/
```

### Option 2:

Leave everything as is.

276656,"> BI applications will suffer greatly as businessbusers must have exact and not approximate results

Some additional thoughts about approaches for building user faith in numbers (dealing with fuzziness and the need for context):

As we move into BI a worry of mine is that search engines are not databases and they are designed to produce fuzzy sets (elements belong to the result set to varying degrees). In our search apps we frequently fail to explain to end users that the results can vary massively in match quality so they should not always put too much stock in any exact numbers we show.
I think the first ES facet I wrote was the one that ""buckets"" the match scores of docs so you can draw a quality distribution for all of the search results. It was largely for my own benefit to view the ""long tail"" of low-quality matches for various query types (more like this, fuzzy etc). 
I can think of a number of approaches to coping-with-fuzzy-sets, none of which are ideal :
a) Offer clients tools to first ""trim"" the long tail of crap e.g. only facet on the top N matches or 
b) Facet summaries can have the option to aggregate quality scores rather than absolute doc counts or
c) ""Fuzzy"" criteria/result sets are automatically spotted and facets not offered or suitable accuracy warnings displayed alongside any aggregations
d) Do nothing - educate users about interpreting results

Users also have to consider any natural skews in the data and it is often useful to put the numbers (inaccurately matched as they may be) into some sort of context:
- The ability to express geo coverage as % of a background distribution: ( for why, see http://xkcd.com/1138/ )
- ""Top"" term selection criteria for term-based facets need not always be ""most popular"" - Mike McCandless and I got into that on his Jira search project: http://goo.gl/vU73gc
- Time-based buckets should be able to diff against corpus stats due to possible fluctuations in corpus size e.g. indeed.com plot skills as a % of all job ads: http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=elasticsearch%2C+solr&l=

In all these scenarios, some background source of stats is required alongside the query result counts as context. The source of this data is typically found looking into the whole corpus.

For performance or API complexity reasons we may choose not to factor any support for these concerns into the core ES design, but it is at least worth acknowledging these issues exist while we are in the design phase.

276676,"Hi,

Sorry, I don't monitor this mailbox very often!

The short answer is not really.

Our real issue is about percolation: in pre 1.x releases, it occurs on the
primary shards, which, when gathered on the same machine, put all the
percolator-related load on this machine.

It seems that the new percolator design introduced in 1.0 solves this issue.

However, we have not migrated yet. Our quick win is to add a third machine.
When we have such a case, switching the guilty machine off (well, kindly
removing it temporarily from the cluster) rebalances the primaries on the
two other nodes. It pretty ugly and not optimal, but it helps.

277466,"Hi,
sorry for getting back to you so late (I was on an extended holiday). You missed something indeed. Actually the lowercase filter does not seem to work when using a template for +logs*.

Using the EXACT SAME template that you posted above, I inserted another message like so:

curl -X PUT 'localhost:9200/logs-20130820/bar/2?refresh=true' -d '{
    ""@time"" : ""2013-01-01"",
    ""@message"":""This is such a Rude Message my Dear Donny"",
    ""@fields"" : { ""a"":""this is not sparta, but a"", ""b"":""oh, look, that is b""} 
}'
{""ok"":true,""_index"":""logs-20130820"",""_type"":""bar"",""_id"":""2"",""_version"":1}

Then:

curl -X GET 'localhost:9200/logs-20130820/bar/_search?q=rude'
{""took"":5,""timed_out"":false,""_shards"":{""total"":1,""successful"":1,""failed"":0},""hits"":{""total"":0,""max_score"":null,""hits"":[]}}

The lowercase filter should have been applied, apparently this is not the case.

When I do this:

curl -X GET 'localhost:9200/logs-20130820/bar/_search?q=Rude'
{""took"":4,""timed_out"":false,""_shards"":{""total"":1,""successful"":1,""failed"":0},""hits"":{""total"":1,""max_score"":0.3125,""hits"":[{""_index"":""logs-20130820"",""_type"":""bar"",""_id"":""2"",""_score"":0.3125, ""_source"" : {
    ""@time"" : ""2013-01-01"",
    ""@message"":""This is such a Rude Message my Dear Donny"",
    ""@fields"" : { ""a"":""this is not sparta, but a"", ""b"":""oh, look, that is b""} 
}}]}}

... we do get an answer.

Note however, that I am using Elasticsearch 0.90.0. Tomorrow I will try the same thing using the latest version (0.90.3).

Note also, that changing the template name for the created indexes to ""+lgs*"" produces the desired results.

Thanks for your support,

> The reason for this behavior is actually down to JSON and binary values. Because binary values in json are strings, trying to auto detect a date for example by trying to convert it to string ends up screwing up the internal parser binary value (I need to check if thats the case still). So we first need to try and match on name without actually knowing the type, and then match on the type...

This patch:

```
         if (unmatch != null && patternMatch(unmatch, name)) {
             return false;
         }
-        if (matchMappingType != null) {
-            if (dynamicType == null) {
-                return false;
-            }
-            if (!patternMatch(matchMappingType, dynamicType)) {
-                return false;
-            }
+        if (dynamicType == null) {
+            return false;
+        }
+        if (matchMappingType != null && !patternMatch(matchMappingType, dynamicType)) {
+            return false;
         }
         return true;
     }

seems to work fine with binary strings, eg:

```

...And on that note I also don't agree with clintongormley's theory of ""make people fix their data."" It's not always ""their"" data...And you can't predict what you might scrape from the internet AND the more schemaless databases and data sources we get the more we run into this issue. 

In fact, people have commonly seen this EOF error with Twitter data. So when you work with a very popular data source / API (even if it's ""incorrect"" or ""bad practice"" - I'm not arguing that dirty data sucks), it's quite easy to see this error.

You can set the `ignore_malformed` setting in your index mapping, but it doesn't seem to help this situation. This is what I would expect though. While we can't reasonably convert data types back and forth...We can choose to ignore them. Otherwise, we have this failure going on which stops initial indexing and it's just bad.

EVEN IF it was at the cost of skipping the entire document from being indexed...That would at least let us get past some of these errors which are typically edge cases to begin with (another reason why people ""just can't clean their data"").

281022,"arimus, kimchy accepted a pull request, fixIndex() is now included: https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/pull/1890 

Exposing a fix method via API has some drawbacks. First, fixing the Lucene segments while the node is up is damn risky. It would impact the whole cluster performance and stability, and would not stop the cluster from being more unstable, you described the problem when new data is stil coming in. Second, node shutdown and startup API usage for checking and fixing indexes is potentially a candidate for race conditions. So, a node must leave the cluster and be stopped to perform the lengthy check and the subsequent optional fix. 

The method which is implemented by kimchy is to take the defect node down (shutdown api or kill), let the ES cluster readjust to the new situation, enable a ""fix"" check setting value explicitly in the defect node index setting and start the node again. Then, the node will enter a quite lengthy check and repair mode, before it re-enables all the index structures and tries to rejoin the cluster.

A warning: because fixing a broken Lucene segment can lead to data loss, this is not for the faint hearted. It should never be assumed fixIndex() should be called on a regular basis at every startup. There is no guarantee at all that fixIndex() will cure all defects. It is a last resort for the advanced adaministrator if nothing else helps and data loss is accepted.

What i mean is this: let's suppose i have imaginary conditions condition1, condition2 and condition3. and i need to find all rows satisfying query: (condition1 && condition 2) || (condition 1 and condition3). This is just an example, in real life the query i have is pretty damned complex and i need to reuse some of it's conditions in many places. So what happens when i use this code:

``` java
BoolQueryBuilder queryPart1 = boolQuery()
for(int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
    queryPart1.must(....); // building up condition1
}

BoolQueryBuilder mainQuery= boolQuery()
    .should(
        queryPart1 // reusing condition1
        .must(...) // adding condition2
    )
    .should(
        queryPart1 // reusing condition1
        .sould(...) // adding condition3
   );
```

in the end I'm ending up with this query: (condition1 && condition2) || (condition1 && condition2 && condition3)

what i'd like to be able to do is:

``` java
// building condition1
BoolQueryBuilder queryPart1 = boolQuery()
for(int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
    queryPart1.must(....);
}

BoolQueryBuilder mainQuery= boolQuery()
    .should(

        .must(...) // adding condition2

    .should(
        queryPart1.clone() // reusing condition1

Its a bit hard to nail this since you descrive two problems that I think are unrelated. It would be great to nail down one at a time.

Second, regarding the single node starting and not recovering from the gateway, can you please set the `gateway.fs` logging to `TRACE` in the `logging.yml` file and post the log of that server (the part where it starts up and does not read it)?

405,"Hello psychoboust, yes, you understood right, with this fork we can trigger 7 FEL file, by converting on the fly to profile 8 when watching it with the kodi fork. You just need to find the option in kodi to enable the conversion (option available into this fork only).
Yes, EL enhancement layer is lost for profile 7 (FEL and MEL as well), but if you ask me, there is no noticeable quality  difference between p7 and P8.1. Personal opinion: EL (enhancement layer)  is kinda bullshit, is more like a marketing thing.
Any 7MEL file plays perfect with ExoPlayer/just player so in that case I don't see any reason to use this kodi fork but stick with it for 7FEL exclusively.
Now I have Philips OLED807 and the image quality is perfect, I really don't need to play 7FEL natively, so I don't need any external player since I don't have any sound system attached to my tv.

It would be very constructive to see ExoPlayer and just player in the future doing this DoVi conversion on the fly, in the mean time I'll stick with the kodi fork (only for 7FEL) as I said into my previous post.

8242,"Oh shoot, I'm sorry I referenced one of my own wrapping methods. I apologize. Let me clarify a few things:

So looking at `2.14.2` we have this method in `PlayerControlView` (added comments are my own)

```
  private void dispatchPlay(Player player) {
    @State int state = player.getPlaybackState();
    if (state == Player.STATE_IDLE) {
      if (playbackPreparer != null) {
        playbackPreparer.preparePlayback();
      } else {
        controlDispatcher.dispatchPrepare(player);
      }
    } else if (state == Player.STATE_ENDED) {
      seekTo(player, player.getCurrentWindowIndex(), C.TIME_UNSET);
    }
    controlDispatcher.dispatchSetPlayWhenReady(player, /* playWhenReady= */ true); // <= this was helpful for us to effectively listen to play/pause click events without having to make all the above player callbacks
  }
  
    private void dispatchPause(Player player) {
    controlDispatcher.dispatchSetPlayWhenReady(player, /* playWhenReady= */ false); // <= same here
  }
  ```
  
In `2.16.1` the `DefaultControlDispatcher` class is gone so we no longer get this convenient callback for when the play/pause is clicked on the control view. So yes `ForwardingPlayer` has `setPlayWhenReady` however that's no longer being called by the `PlayerControlView`. Even though `player.play()` and `player.pause()` are called in the latest `PlayerControlView` (which invokes `setPlayWhenReady`), this doesn't let us distinguish play/pause from the control UI vs other consumer/lifecycle methods (ie we call these methods in other locations of our codebase).

I was also looking at the code change and noticed, perhaps we were just fortunate to have `dispatchSetPlayWhenReady` only being invoked by both the `dispatchPlay` and `dispatchPause` callbacks found in `PlayerControlView` as it gave us a convenient method to listen for when the play/pause buttons were clicked.

Maybe my question is more of a feature request:

Ability to listen to when the play/pause buttons in `PlayerControlView` are clicked, without overwriting the `onClickListener` set inside the class. If that makes sense?

play in exoplayer... we need to use the main exoplayer function  load video

see in this case.

But i dont know why this is happening.. how u said..  its happen with you
too .. its take almost 4 second to play a video with 20 seconds..  in
somewhere is a problem..  I can imagine that google cloud storage have a
high latency for storage..
i imagine the inverse.. they have a low and quality latency ..

But i dont know what to do..if we can't do that.. because i cant change my
storage server.... so.. in amazon s3 is take the same time, but i dont have
a video there anymore.

I just need load 20 seconds video faster ..just that. =/

<-- start personal opinion: this does not express any other opinion than mine. :)  --

Given no video player would support that content you would not have this problem now, because you could not play it at all. You, or WDR, would have noticed this problem very early, you would have spoken to the packager and they would have fixed the problem in the packager. Then the file would have been re-encoded correctly. 

By not being strict, players force other player to support strictly speaking invalid content as well. This makes the implementation of such players not only more complex, but likely also less efficient (battery) and slower (user experience). You might know the Internet Explorer-situation in which all web browsers are forced to support crappy content. All web developer love that  ;)

1. When onPlayerStateChanged receives the STATE_ENDED event, call setPlayWhenReady(false) to pause the video, and seek to just before the end (say, 10ms) - possibly not in this order.

2. Set a dispatcher that, if dispatchSetPlayWhenReady is called when playWhenReady == true and the current position is just before the end, calls seekTo(0) before dispatching playWhenReady(true).

they have differnt soc ,butthe original pixel 's soc is able to do the decoding in other phone made by other manufacturers like samsung s7e(people say when this phone came out it can play,the samsung patched it ,so it won't play,maybe some patent issue),lg g6,and many chinese phone's with shitty screen(chinese phone don't care about patent XD,but they will play)
10 bit hevc is within snapdragon 821 and 820's capabilities

33729,"Hi @androidlab! I had the same question https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/2874 The most correct way to achieve this is to create custom image renderer as pointed by @ojw28. But if you have limited resources/time you can just write a wrapper around SimpleExoPlayer and display ImageView above the TextureView. It's trickier and built on top of callback hell (Player.EventListener, ImageLoaderCallback) but is reliable at some extent.
As I see you already have custom model to distinguish videos/images. All you need is to generate N seconds monochrome video (using ffmpeg for example) which you play on image tracks.

```Java
private MediaSource trackToMediaSource(@NonNull Track track) {
	MediaSource source;
	Uri trackUri;
	switch (track.getType()) {
	    case VIDEO:
	    	trackUri = Uri.parse(track.getUrl());
	        ...
	        break;
	    case IMAGE:
	        // Currently images are not supported. We use hardcoded video URL as a workaround.
	        trackUri = Uri.parse(""asset:///blue.mp4"");
	        ...
	        break;
	    ...
	}
        ...
	return source;
}
```

FFmpeg command:

```bash
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color=c=#10408c -t 5 blue.mp4

35725,"This isn't something we support directly, and it's difficult to come up with a general purpose solution. It is possible to manually set the preferred refresh rate, if you want to set it to match the content being played. You can query the available rates using:
```
Display display = activity.getWindowManager().getDefaultDisplay();
float[] refreshRates = display.getSupportedRefreshRates();
```
And set your preferred rate using:
```
Window window = activity.getWindow();
WindowManager.LayoutParams layoutParams = window.getAttributes();
layoutParams.preferredRefreshRate = refreshRates[preferredRateIndex];
window.setAttributes(layoutParams);
```

Note that in practice, most people opt not to do this. TVs often handle mode changes in a very ugly way (e.g. screen flashing black for a while), and of course if you set the refresh rate to something like 24Hz, that means any playback control animations (or whatever) are all going to run at 24Hz too, which is going to look pretty janky. You can mitigate this to some extent by selecting the highest refresh rate that's a clean multiple of the content FPS (so if the content is 24fps you should probably prefer 48Hz to 24Hz, if both are available).

Note that we do some frame release timestamp adjustments inside of the player to do a pretty decent job of mapping 24fps (and other fps values) onto the default 60Hz display refresh. In practice these adjustments do a pretty good job of minimizing the issue.",1,0,prediction_comments_exoplayer.csv

The problem we have is that the player is trying to recover, but the recovery mechanism that works for most streaming technologies doesn't work for this case, and so recovery doesn't work properly and the player goes into a bad state. The workaround would be to disable retries in the player, so that the app would always receive an error (and have to retry itself). Kind of sucks as an experience for the user though.

47119,"I would argue this is a MediaCodec/libstagefright bug not an ExoPlayer bug as MediaCodec is what's doing the rendering. ExoPlayer is just managing the samples and timing. Also this is evident in the Lollipop libstagefright fix in which it respects the rotation (which screws things up for my use and I had to add this to counteract it)

```
            MediaFormat format = extractor.getTrackFormat(trackIndex);
            if (format.containsKey(""rotation-degrees"")) {
                // Decoded video is rotated automatically in Android 5.0 lollipop.

                format.setInteger(""rotation-degrees"", 0);
            }
```
",1,1,prediction_comments_exoplayer.csv
47131,"Urgh, this is a bit of a mess at the platform level. Application of rotation is inconsistent between both API levels (pre-L v.s. L+) and (in L at least) between decoders at a fixed API level. It appears that on M+ OMX.google.h264.decoder does actually apply the rotation, but you're correct in noting that this does not happen when running L.

Unfortunately, as of now, there's no easy way to determine whether a decoder has actually applied the rotation. I'm not sure how consistent the application of rotation is between decoders in M. I'll be pushing for more consistent application of rotation (if this hasn't happened already) and/or the ability to determine whether the rotation was applied in the next platform release.

For ExoPlayer, always propagating the rotation value doesn't seem like the right thing to do. That just moves the problem of working out what to do from the library to every individual application developer, who will then each have to figure out what different decoders do on different API levels. Instead, I think we probably want to work out what the current behaviors are and hardcode these inside the library, so that the rotation delivered to the application always ends up being correct (i.e. 0 when using a decoder that applied the rotation, non-zero otherwise). Hopefully we can also get consistent behavior across all video decoders from some version of the platform and above, since this makes the developer's life significantly easier.

Re-opening for tracking. First step is to try and figure out exactly what behavior we should be expecting across the various API levels / decoder implementations.

4696,"As stated a several times, its the nature of the beast. And so many different factors can contribute to the lower response on TechEmpowered.

Hardware:

Your CPU core are newer with a higher base speed so it can push more instructions per core.  The 40 (  40 + 40 HT ) Core server they use is a multi socket system and multi socket also introduces latency with inner communication. Add to this servers tend to run FB-DIMM what is different beast then your Unbuffered-Dimms. 

Hell, maybe your CPU is using SSL instructions that the 40 core does not have. Take in account that CPU is from 2011. Your was from 2013. Changes happen all the time to CPU designs.

That is one factor. And we do not even go into L1, L2, L3 cache speeds, hits and misses. A one thread PHP webserver can enjoy the full cache for itself without switching out data.

You see how fast hardware differences stack up? The hardware they bench on is freaking old. I have gone in the past from a dual socket 12 core, 24 thread to a 8 core, 16 thread single socket system. You expect me to lose performance, no ... i gained 50% more performance. Just because of hardware differences.

PS: Your CPU is only a 2 Core ( 2 + 2 HT ). 

Programs tend to do way better also in single thread vs multi thread as this introduces way more issues like context switching and other delays. People think if i go from 2 core to 4 core ( assuming your cache etc all double to match ), then my programs will be double as fast. Wrong ... You gain maybe 90% at best as multi threading introduces issues and overhead.

Communications:

All requests go over Nginx. This is another bottleneck because Nginx needs to handle each request, make contact with PHP-FPM. Wait for the response and give you back the response. Unlike a build in Webserver this massive delays communication. If Nginx is not finely tuned for handling a specific load, it will server as a bottleneck. Each load is different... You can probably fine tune Nginx to better respond to the json benchmark but as a result it may hurt the other benchmarks.

Network:

Your forgetting a important part. You are local benching on your system! That means you do not have any network communication delays. TechEmpower simulates a more real world scenario with clients contacting the servers, setting up a communication, waiting for responds, then sending there request ...

Local machine testing is never the same as network testing. Run a local echo ""hello world"" server, now run the same echo server on a remote hardware and you will see a drop in performance simple because of the communication layer delays. A standard internal network has somewhere between 0.1 second delay, do that with thousands of requests and it stacks up. Try doing a external test and its even worse.

PHP: 

As stated a lot before, for every request PHP needs to accept the communication. This is a MASSIVE hit in performance. Check the cache ( if you use APC cache ), run they bytecode ( transform this to actual executable code ), perform whatever code, get the results and return it over this same communication.

OS: ... can go one for a while.

There are so many factors at play...  This is why benchmarks are the root of all evil. Even small and stupid details can have a massive effect on performance. You keep comparing a system that is as alien then what you are running hardware size, under totally different testing conditions network, under different configuration conditions.

This is the last responds from me on this subject as it adds nothing useful to the discussion to solve the issue. Because the issue can not be solved without having direct access to the hardware to see and fine tune each part to gain the maximum performance. 

And that is not what TechEmpowered there test is about. Its about **comparing languages on the same system**, how they stack up against each other. NOT how languages stack up on different systems.",1,1,prediction_comments_frameworkbenchmarks.csv

Even if you can, there is a crap top of special character escaping going on. Based on this, it seems to me that using travis-ci is just a stopgap until there is a proper continuous benchmarking toolset. Even with this PR, we are still consuming a nontrivial amount of travis-ci resources _and_ the difficulty of interpreting the travis results has increased to the point that it's infeasible for novices. To understand [these results](https://travis-ci.org/hamiltont/FrameworkBenchmarks/builds/56227622) you need to know that there are groupings of frameworks, you need to be able to find your frameworks grouping, and you need to be able to parse out the log files for your framework specifically. This all boils down to a poor experience, especially for people just interested in submitting a quick change and moving on with their lives. 

So unless TFB has soem way to pay travis for our usage, I expect that this solution will need to be replaced by a continous benchmarking running on the peak hardware

As for this PR - it's still critical we merge ASAP to reduce our travis load (>24 hours to 9 hours is no trivial reduction), and as soon as the precise groupings are found in the `.travis.yml` (to avoid the 50 minute limit per job imposed by travis-ci) we should merge

You can set the owner / group / modes at mount time, but after the mount commands like chown/chmod do nothing and you cannot have files owned by two different users anywhere inside the shared folder. 

This naturally sucks, but after some playing there's an easy fix - bind mount a normal linux folder over top of the ""installs"" folder as so: 

```
echo ""Mounting over your installs folder""
mkdir -p /tmp/TFB_installs
mkdir -p /FrameworkBenchmarks/installs
sudo mount -o bind /tmp/TFB_installs $FWROOT/installs
```

This masks the original installs folder, so while `/FrameworkBenchmarks` is synchronized to the host system, `/FrameworkBenchmarks/installs` is not. However, you can now chown/chmod `installs` and anything under it as expected.

There are two prevailing schools of thought on the issue I mentioned above (`plaintext` can reliably get otherwise reasonable frameworks to completely hang in amazing ways):
1. Nuke everything between test iterations (there are essentially 5 `plaintext`s run, 5 `db`s, etc at different concurrencies) and reissue another small priming run before each iteration.
2. It's at the fault of the framework/stack author, and they should resolve it.

There are MANY problems with the first, but they almost entirely boil down to ""more work for TE et al"" whereas the problems with the second are many and unfair. For instance, many of the Python frameworks which suffer from this problem do not seem to be stuck in actual framework code, but rather somewhere in the netstack in a Python library. While this does show a limitation of choosing such a framework, it's ultimately something in the stack outside the control of the author... and I feel like punishing the framework for a shortcoming of the language is rather punitive.

That said, it is somewhat infeasible for us to run rounds if they they take 6 days to complete. We cannot justify the cost of running Amazon EC2 instances for that long on this type of project (currently, we spin them up for the first preview and the final run, then immediately shut them down once we've captured their logs).

Darn, I have already solved these issues. Sorry, I should have linked you to the [latest log run](https://travis-ci.org/hamiltont/FrameworkBenchmarks/builds/32817526) (PS - if you link to the travis-ci.org page you can still find the log, but if you link straight to the log you cannot find the travis-ci.org page where that log came from). 

The various nginx exceptions in the lastest log appear to be symptoms of the mono build failing (although if you spot something different I'm open). 

> upgrade mono

It's on the agenda, but I want to make this work with the current version first. I've already updated the mono [installation script](https://github.com/hamiltont/FrameworkBenchmarks/blob/0e32b4b3f2ee456783f763760276b73b93f5e05c/toolset/setup/linux/languages/mono.sh) in my branch to remove that apt-get install `mono-devel` and put mono into a prefix folder. I can replace the configure with the autogen easily, and replace the `make EXTERNAL_MCS` line in my current install script with just a `make` command. 

I've also updated the [xsp install script](https://github.com/hamiltont/FrameworkBenchmarks/blob/7951d86223475aea645edfb835f18c2dfb45ece5/toolset/setup/linux/languages/xsp.sh) slightly, so if you see bug there? I just pointed xsp to mono's install prefix and it seemed to work. 

Just so you understand how this is working, the `bash_profile.sh` file [here](https://github.com/hamiltont/FrameworkBenchmarks/blob/ccd4844d4373838c3e3622abde028f60a0fc7f4c/frameworks/C%23/aspnet/bash_profile.sh) is loaded into the environment before we call setup.py, so if setup.py says 'mono' then it uses the mono found in `$MONO_ROOT/bin`

ASP.NET vNext will eliminate only the second problem. For Mono they use NOwin, which is still limited by Mono's network subsystem. It can be eliminated by creating Mono.Sockets on top of libuv or something like that (See http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-devel-list/2014-May/041484.html )

Items of note:
- On .NET 4.5 the default max threads appears to be 32k in IIS, with lower values in IIS Express.  This differs from 4.0, where it was 12 \* CPUs.
- Min counts are still 1 with .NET 4.5.
- The 'min' thread option is misleading.  It doesn't actually cause that many threads to be created and instead sets a bound on the number of immediately 'burstable' threads (i.e. threads that can be created as soon as needed).  Once the min thread limit is reached, the runtime throttles new thread creation at the rate of 1/500ms, up until the max thread limit.
- Additionally, if the system load is low, the runtime rather aggressively kills off idle threads, pushing the count below the 'min' value (I've observed this behavior with .NET 4.0 and it's likely the same with 4.5).
- Since no IO completion ports are needed for the tests, the min/max completion ports _should_ have no bearing on perf.  Inspecting the threadpool confirms no active io threads during the tests.

In any case, I certainly wish Microsoft had better and definitive documentation around this!  The best resource regarding this  is quite out of date -> http://blogs.msdn.com/b/tmarq/archive/2007/07/21/asp-net-thread-usage-on-iis-7-0-and-6-0.aspx.

@bhauer I just want to say that the above as an ultimate goal makes this project very useful to people like me. It is hard to avoid chiming in with a passionate rebuttal when your choice framework is way to the bottom. Emotions definitely come into play when you visit a site and see the charts which seem to say your framework sucks. 

As an asp.net guy myself I have been working on performance improvements for a client application and come to the same conclusions expressed by you and others. That is, aside from the code, there are many factors which contribute to less than expected results. 

I am in the process of creating a plan to test for performance bottlenecks in my client application so the asp.net discussion is very interesting to me. To add to that discussion I would like to suggest asp.net startup time as a possible explanation for the disappointing results. 

I would suggest as an improvement to the benchmark tool you factor out the results which come back during startup time for all frameworks. As a statistic averages can be very useful but they don't always lead you to the conclusion you should in each situation. This is probably true when hitting an asp.net server on startup at the micro second level. If my assertion about startup time is correct, when you plot the results of the asp.net requests over time you should get a graph which shows a sharp curve trending upwards. I believe the benchmark recording should begin at the point this graph flatlines.

14123,"Why latency matters --- generally speaking, when performance tuning a
system -- you're looking at outlier performance.  The average is not that
meaningful.  Example:

1 out of 100k requests takes 100k seconds.
The rest take 5ms.

The reported average latency is now
499995 ms + 100000000ms/100k = 1.0049 sec.

That looks slow.  Call in the engineers, we have to optimize!  (or maybe
not....)

If you looked a a distribution -- you'd see:
25th 5ms
50th 5ms
75th 5ms
90th 5ms
99th 5ms
999th 5ms
max: 100k sec
Average: 1 s

And you would know without a moments hesitation that the system is
performing fine.  the average is easy to ignore when you can see that there

## is clear outliers that skew it.

The same is true in reverse, the average could be skewed low by fast
requests hiding a substantial number of users suffering crappy performance.

If you have good average latency you could still have crappy 90th
percentile latency.  And that means that 10% of your customers are seeing
something bad.  Thats not good for reputation.

Without looking at the distribution, its really hard to draw any
conclusions at all from a mean.  So ... while I find latency interesting
""in general"".  I think presenting it in this context is tricky to
interpret.  But now that I know how its calculated -- it may have more
value than I first thought.

Its also true that users notice latency variance more than latency itself.
When something is sometimes fast, and sometimes slow -- they will notice
the slow more than if it was always a little slow.

As for the tests -- I agree as the throughput rises, the latency comparison
becomes increasingly suspect.  Due to reduced sampling.  So rank ordering
them is... perhaps unfair.  Maybe you could present it as you suggest using
buckets.  Latency below 10ms, below 50ms, below 100ms, 500ms, 1s... etc,
and declare every thing in that bucket ""tied"".  It might be more fair than
declaring Go to be superior to Netty when the throughput numbers suggest
that ""on average"" that isn't the case.

That said, the sampling pulls out the outliers and tells you something
about what ""typical"" latency might be.  While less rigorous than a
distribution -- i'm coming to the conclusion that its probably indicative
of what you're ""likely"" to see as a latency value.

In the case of Go -- it points to a few requests taking a very long time.
(skewing the averages) But most completing fast.  In the case of netty --
same user experience and given the throughput superiority -- the tail of
the distribution is no doubt smaller.

Its all a bit like tea leaf reading without the distribution.  So actually
now that i know its sampled -- I almost prefer this because it gives an
independent axis for looking at the distribution.  If it was every
connection and an average, it would be no more informative than the
throughput numbers.

When the external service adds an additional 100 ms delay, this increases concurrency on the local app, which slows performance, which increases concurrency, which slows performances, which increase concurrency... _splat_. 

Finding tools and frameworks that can handle this case elegantly is going to be one of the major challenges of developers over the next few years as they go from depending on one external service (their own DB mostly) to multiple.  Having a tech stack they know can handle this also allows them to outsource things they don't care about in a sane way.

I tested with my graylog installation which is behind nginx with a subpath.

I set `http_external_uri=https://hostname.tld/gl/` , which is where graylog is accessible from.
I tried setting `http_publish_uri=http://127.0.0.1:9000`. This did not work. I  then set it to match the value I set `http_external_uri` to. This also did not work. I saw the same error.

- When do you use the Grok-Debugger aside from editing or creating a Grok Pattern?
- What do you do with the Grok Pattern you tested when not Saving it in either a Extractor or a new Grok Pattern?

I would also say that people do not usually create their own patterns because it is so damn hard without something to test on.

In your particular case, what I saw after a quick look is that your dashboard is actually querying data from yesterday. Assuming that your data sources have the right time configuration, the data will not change during the day. Of course, I might be assuming too much.

Would you be so kind as to elaborate a bit more on when you experience this issue? I am specially interested if you see the data from yesterday changing during the day (you can verify by playing the ""replay search"" button in one of your widgets every now and then).

I think this is the exact same issue as we have today in the CP system with locks in general, at any point in time two clients might be in the same critical section at the same time.

Regarding the `Partition#getOwner` triggering partition assignments, I am thinking about how it could lead to a congestion, because a non-master member triggers master to perform partition assignment and does not do the re-trigger until it receives a partition state response. On the master, however, partition state initialization is very fast and performed only once, except e.g., cluster state change. 

From the above, stack trace of `ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3`, it seems `applyNewPartitionTable` on a non-master member is blocked on acquiring partition service lock with unreasonably high wait time on the thread (`waited=18986580 msecs`), which smells like a deadlock, but that also does not make much sense, since pinging master and processing partition state result is handled asynchronously 🤔",1,0,prediction_comments_hazelcast.csv

To let the `MergingValueFactory` return `null` was an optimization for the merge operations (to have less code to produce an `existingValue` with `null`, in case there is no data on in the larger cluster). But I didn't think of the origin side. That should be quite easy to fix though. I'll prepare a PR for that.

For your second point: There should still be no concurrent modification on the merging node, since the collected container is removed from the service (there is an `iterator.remove()` call somewhere in the collector, which does this). So if there is a race with ongoing migrations, it happens on a new container, not the collected one. 

I think there is a potential for several races, as I mentioned in our Google document. If I'm not wrong you can still use a merging local instance during the merging, and add new operations (in embedded mode).

After that when we found out that await is misssing we added await. Now it works without making the method synchronized. Thanks for your help. Apologies , Looks like a goof up from our end.

Flush is useful only when you have a map store defined. See it's contract:

     * If this map has a MapStore, this method flushes

And most do a very bad job at it anyway, because they are slow as hell. The fact that there are so many, introduces complexity on all levels and in some cases even causes conflicts in deployment. Ever had the fun of SLF4J version incompatibilities?

If it were up to me, speaking on my personal behalf, all logging API's apart from the one in the JRE should be dropped. This is the API that should be used by programmers. The implementation of this API is where logging frameworks can do their magic.

You are right. We have seen this issue and working on a fix for it. Thanks for reporting it.

Although it is a nasty hack, you could apply the ManagedContext yourself or make sure that dependencies are set so that the ManagedContext doesn't need to be called. This way you can continue till we have fixed the issue.

Let me go one step further. Here's a two-node hazelcast cluster running inside one JVM. Each HazelcastInstance won't have the same reference to an underlying list.

When I destroy the queue in one cluster, it is empty when retrieved from the other cluster.

When I destroy the list in one cluster, it _is not_ empty when retrieved from the other cluster.

The list isn't destroyed because it screws up the name and actualName variables (""q:l:list"" and ""l:list"")

I was chatting to a journalist that works at a big news organization (I won't name the exact one for, for reasons that will shortly become apparent). 

A few years ago, during the Arab spring, another journalist was talking to a person in Syria using Skype. The Syrian government, under Bashar al-Assad, was monitoring all of the internet communciations to the outside world. They noticed that somebody was talking to an IP address at the news organization in question. They looked up records at the ISP, and found the subscribers address. They then sent a death squad around to the persons house, who examined the computers in the house, then promptly disappeared the person who had been reporting stories of atrocities to the international press. We don't know what happened that person, but they were never heard of again. They were more than likely shot in the back of the head, or suffocated to death with a plastic bag, and their body discarded in an unmarked grave.

This wasn't an isolated incident: people were disappeared for posting comments that were not complimentary to the regime on social media, such as Facebook.

You mentioned that ""plausbile deniability"" is not a good enough reason to allow sending of non-signed messages.

**Plansible deniability is as a good reason as any.** It can prevent murder.

1. Say your IT department or tech wiz idiot nephew sets up your phone with k9mail
2. You should be able to export/import a config file from that and into Thunderbird (chiefly) and Evolution (my case) or Outlook (can one dream?) such that the user doesn't have to think about IMAP settings
3. If a non-technical user has to think about IMAP settings at any point in this process, then it has failed its purpose. ",1,1,prediction_comments_k9.csv
5475,"Ah, okay. 

So, apparently with Evolution, there's something called [Autoconfig](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evolution/Autoconfig) available for sysadmins to set up on email servers (I believe) where it provides a standard WebDav location where settings are downloaded and applied for the client. 

This sounds like a really nice solution to prevent users from having to dig into the scary internals of email protocols I feel. 

It's also a bit of sprinkles on top of a crap sandwich though (with the whole email config situation). So, I'm not sure how I feel about that. This far pre-dates k9mail though.

https://www.linode.com/community/questions/8831/postfix-reject_non_fqdn_helo_hostname

If the mail is on port 25, as it is supposed to be from another server, then that is probably a good idea.

If on the other hand there is a client trying to log in on port 587 and use STARTTLS and AUTH for relay privileges, then the reject_non_fqdn_helo_hostname option is probably unnecessary, and will almost surely prevent authenticated clients from sending mail.

It is a little confusing to me, because the postfix configuration is somewhat ""mixed"" between ""main.cf"" and the inetd-like ""master.cf"" as to which options apply on which open ports.

If anyone of you would entrust your life to this consider yourself dead.",1,0,prediction_comments_k9.csv
8154,"@doak: you say autocrypt 1.0 is not bulletproof. I stand by my original statement - if you would entrust your life to autocrypt consider yourself dead. Optimism has no place in good security design. We are not dealing with random bullets but with adversaries which will deliberately target every weakness left - any exploitable weakness is equivalent to being doomed. 

Autocrypt is by design vulnerable to a wide range of active attacks, accidental malfunction and security downgrade triggered by spam, as well as deliberate DOS and opportunisitc eavesdropping by anyone who can spoof email addresses.  Authors of the standard say its security depends on a working spam filter - does that sound like strong security? Wild guess.. pretty soon spammers will start inserting fake autocrypt headers to improve ham/spam score of their messages. 

Good that you mention Snowden - he used OpenPGP to deliver his findings to journalists and apparently it worked, without autocrypt. And it is a nice reading how he did it. Good security is damned difficult but not impossible to teach to an average journalist. OpenPGP and long before that PGP were for decades unrivalled in security and nightmare of secret services all over the world as Snowden nicely demonstrated. Near perfect security required certain effort like key signing parties or other means of oob key verification and nontrivial setup. 

Autocrypt is much easier to use but so far offers zero to marginal security gain over plain unencrypted email. Nowadays pretty much all MSPs offer encrypted connections and delivery between MSPs tends to be encrypted as well, hence very little chance for your neighbor to eavesdrop. Or if he can you have bigger problems.  However both target and origin MSPs are in the perfect position to MITM autocrypt.  If your adversary is a blood thirsty dictator, make sure none of your software and contacts use autocrypt. If your adversary is anyone with a surveilance court order, forget autocrypt. In addition to MITM if your adversary is anyone who can spoof email addresses forget it.

Talking about future.. my fear is that the blatantly weak autocrypt security design together with a slew of inconsistent and buggy mua implementations will be the last nail into the coffin of email encryption. No need for autocrypt 2.0. Not only will autocrypt users be very  vulnerable but by interoperability and bugs the security of old style OpenPGP will be annihilated. 
 
Compare Autocrypt security design with that of Signal messenger protocol. Imho no need to waste resources on something so inferior. 
",1,1,prediction_comments_k9.csv
8160,"This is terrible. Does anyone at least know *why* it happens? Is it just random or is there a workaround? Autocrypt is enabled for sender and receiver. We've exchanged multiple mails. But still, new mails are not encrypted by default no matter what I try. Sorry for the harsh words but in my opinion that was a *seriously* dumb decision. 

I have public keys from people in my key store for a reason. And then I write a mail, but still it isn't encrypted. You remove a perfectly simple and even for novices easy-to-understand option (you have a public key of someone, you write them encrypted mail), recommend enabling AutoCrypt (which would be perfectly okay for me as a workaround) but then enabling this option doesn't have any effect. You just can't make this stuff up.

And the blog post explaining why this is introduced is so extremely flawed in its argumentation that I just don't know where to begin with. If I'd put on my tinfoil hat for a moment, I'd almost assume this is done intentionally to keep people from encrypting mails.

But, okay, I understand there's probably no real way forward here (ironic how the blog post claims it's ""the only way forward"" while the exact opposite is true) since this mess seems to be intended. 

AquaMail unfortunately doesn't support PGP. Would even pay for it. There is a new player called ""FairEmail"", but the author also has very peculiar ideas. For example, you have to confirm every link you click in a special dialog window. Unusable in a commercial environment where you get lots of mails from JIRA etc. everyday. But perhaps it works for some people. 

Sad that in 2019 this is still so unnecessarily broken at a time where Thunderbird has vowed to modernize their PGP support and deliver it built-in without a plugin in the future. Now, we'd only need a decent mail client with PGP support for Android. Sigh...

I really respect your work but your blogpost makes me sad because I don't see what problem you try to fix with that. It's like you are chasing shadows.

If somebody isn't capable to handle encrypted email they don't go through the hassle of setting up encryption plugins, creating keys and exchanging them with their communication partners. So there is nothing that could be ""accidentally"" encrypted and then become inaccessible. Where are the droves of users that are in anguish of their securely encrypted emails that you try to protect with this?

On the other hand you now risk everyone using encryption to accidentally not encrypting their message and thus risking their privacy or causing financial damage or even worse.


I also don't see how deactivating encryption by default is helping to spread encrypted communication. If Whatsapp and Threema taught us anything it's that 90% of people simply forget to activate encryption (Threema. Look it up! They regularly bust people because of this.) if it isn't activated by default. (Like it is with Whatsapp or Signal.)


People want simple encryption but you are adding an additional layer of complexity and thus making encrypted communication even more complicated. Your whole blog post reads like ""Encryption is too complex and overwhelms lots of people. So lets make it even more complicated, bothersome and unintuitive to use so only absolute hardcore nerds and privacy advocates are willing and able to jump through all hoops. This way we make sure that nobody accidentally encrypts their email and then loses access to it at the cost that way less email is getting encrypted overall. *This way we ensure that encrypted email is becoming more widespread available in future.*""

In makes me sad because you either work against your own goals or actually value theoretical availability issues for a few corner cases over the confidentiality of all PGP users.

We've also been speccing this out very carefully, and hope to gain some traction in other email clients. At least Enigmail is on board, and I've been receiving very positive feedback whenever I laid out those ideas to anyone (and taken over multiple cryptoparties that way).

As for ratcheting, I would go even further than cketti and say it's impossible to have for email.

i found out already, that it is a fatal idea to put non-draft-messages into the folder for drafts. have created an issue for that, but yet no response.
 
 i can only speculate: perhaps there's something special with sent messages, too, say, with their identifiers, so that the problem may occur once in a while (i just tried it with two regular sent messages being in the sent folder + 1 added/moved received message: can't reproduce the behaviour which u describe, even after sync. but perhaps just too few data?)

 Recreate data works. 
 
 Except the problem then instantly occurs next time you append a message to that folder. 
 
 One thing I am not sure i made clear is that the issue happens in folders where you move or append a message. 
 
 Say you move a message from inbox to another folder which had pre existing messages, that folder will now be messed up. 
 
 That's why the sent folder is always messed up. 
 
 Recreate data will work only temporarily until the first message you add to that folder..

I realise Autocrypt probably uses PGP under the hood but that's kind of an implementation detail as far as the user is concerned.

This way we can keep all the compatibility with PGP in the UI. If you're using PGP we show the ugly dark side of the coin. If you're using Autocrypt it's the funky one-click stuff in the UI. Internally we can share code as much as is sensible, with Autocrypt passing in the PGP settings it wants to use where that's useful.

It might be worth looking at how firefox/etc. have evolved to deal with ssl cert issues.   There is a nice green padlock showing right now next to github, and sometimes it's missing, and I get a big scary popup for bad signatures, expired keys, unknown CAs, etc.    Part of (most of) why this is hard is because the world is messy enough in practice that OpenPGP hasn't taken off like ssl, but there don't seem to be any better options in email.

Sorry, I uninstalled your app, it already cost me $35 for ""over-eating"" my data plan, I’m not going to install it again and risk to have to pay some more because or erratic behavior of K9.

Sorry.

On top, I’ve got ± 10 email address, so I would need to re-enter each of them manually, which would take me hours to redo all the settings for each of them (because, as an example, even if I use the same signature for all my accounts, I have to enter it on each account [what about a button ""apply to all my email accounts""] and this is a real pain in my butt).

Although I will not use K9 anymore, just thought you’d like to know that I noticed this:

Package com.fsck.k9 has mismatched UID: 1000 on disk, 10305 in settings

This is in uiderrors.txt located in /data/system/

Since I uninstalled your app, I do not get anymore this freakin’ error message every reboot (every morning in my case):

UIDs on the system are inconsistent. You need to wipe your data partition or your device will be unstable.

I’m feeling lucky

I’ve been using your app for months with no issue, but having to re-create all my email accounts, and having to re-enter all my settings (which again would take me hours) is definitely NOT appealing and on top, I just risk to see the app starting again to suck both my CPU and my data plan, sorry, but I’m not willing to go there at all.

Thanks for your reply though.

Good luck.

15892,"**Transcribing my comments on the mailing list:**

From Android's perspective /storage/emulated/0 is considered external storage. Basically the device manufacturer gets to decide what external storage really is. It's better classified as ""typically fixed on device storage logically separated from the normal storage""

The very fact that the Nexus line doesn't contain removable storage options tells you how much Google care about this.

See https://commonsware.com/blog/2014/04/08/storage-situation-external-storage.html for the completely insane tortured logic that gets you there.

Also: https://commonsware.com/blog/2014/04/09/storage-situation-removable-storage.html

What and end user thinks of 'external storage' is better named 'removable storage'.

And for Android 4.4 the problem is (again quoting):

""... apps cannot write to or otherwise modify such removable storage. Note that device manufacturers themselves may have ways of dealing with this, but ordinary app developers do not.""

For Android 5.0 there is a solution documented here:

https://metactrl.com/docs/sdcard-on-lollipop/

We need to implement this if we want to support SD card support.

This also does need careful design as we probably want to avoid:
- Other apps reading our files (which you don't get in 'internal storage')
- Storing unencrypted copies of encrypted content
- The app crashing without explanation if an SD card with all the settings and stuff on being removed

I also think that asking users to provide the path for 'external storage' is bad UX anyway. Using a file browser would be better. This whole setting needs ripping out and improving in a backward compatible manner.

There's lots of related improvements to do in this sort of area, like the ability to inspect where K-9 is actually using storage (big messages etc).

15895,"No because:

a) It would be horribly hacky.
b) It would likely result in more obscure issues being raised as bugs taking up developer time.
c) It would not work on newer versions of Android where permission has to be granted
d) It would do odd things (likely in a way that resulted in inconsistent state) if the removable storage was removed mid-poll.

I'm absolutely against replacing one ugly setting that few change, with more ugly settings that few change and exposing more of Android's ugly internals.

We should do it properly or not all. Supporting removable storage is a new enhancement - there is no justification for hacking it in badly.

This is the first time anyone requested NO comments. Usually code gets rejected
if it doesn't meet very strict ""comment everything, explain what it is+what it's used for"" rules.
I feel explaining why it's needed is required, because on a phone most developers will ever only
see exactly 1 notification per account any may try to remove or ignore that part and thus break it
without noticing that he/she breaks code that is for devices he/she doesn't test with or even know about.

> return !(account.isAnIdentity(message.getFrom()) && !account.isNotifySelfNewMail());

Android Studio asked to refactor that and it does indeed look easier to read to me. YMMV

That's why it's commented out.

However, I don't think this is the right approach. This pull request doesn't address the core problem that prevents us from having proper PGP/MIME support. It's the fact that K-9 Mail doesn't store messages in a way that allows reconstructing byte-identical copies of the original message. Worse, we can't even retrieve the structure of the original MIME tree.
This pull request contains a lot of very nasty hacks to (try to) work around problems caused by K-9 Mail not properly storing messages. When looking at the code I could think of many different ways for this to break. So I wouldn't want us to include this even as temporary solution.

I recently started working on making the necessary changes to K-9 Mail's backend in my spare time. I also started collecting money to be able to work on this full-time. We'll see how that goes.

If you want to change email templates, or if we eventually enable specific capabilities to clients when executing their actions, we probably don't want to be forced to update the client used by the admin console.

What am I doing wrong?",1,0,prediction_comments_keycloak.csv
21849,"@andreaTP The initial problem is already solved, due to switching the default distribution and merging #9309. See e.g. https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/runs/5013840725?check_suite_focus=true this run which only changes some docs, quarkus tests were failing bc. docker path didn't match new path anymore.

Nevertheless I wouldn't consider this a workaround at all, but a sensible order. If situations like the above occur, atm we would lose all information about quarkus-dist specific tests do what we expect.
So we're just left with ""ok. fails. damn. Let's check everything that could have failed"" without having additional information points such as ""do the tests fail using the plain dist?"" ""is there something wrong with the docker daemon on gha in general?""

It's just plain ""doesn't work, look through all layers"", which is bad. 

By rearranging and executing the _least complex_ tests first, this makes much more sense and removes the need to search through all the layers. A container _around_ the dist _is_ another layer of complexity around the plain dist, and as such leaves more space to failure than the usual plain image. 

With this change we would at least know ""ah, ok, in general it works, but there's something wrong either in our docker testsuite processing or in the actual code that runs executed in a docker image"", which is better than ""well. fails. damn. Was it in our code? was it gha docker problems? Was it our docker image creation process? or was it the actual code which behaves differently from a docker container""?. 

Now it's: 
1) run plain dist tests.
2) run database related tests (that would also fail when docker in general is not available)
3) run dockerized tests (that would only fail if our processing/setup is wrong for whatever reason or there's really different behaviour running from docker than running plain)",1,1,prediction_comments_keycloak.csv

22436,"Hello, I had the same problem and found a solution after many hours searching on JBoss documentation pages... Keycloak documentation really sucks, it is outdated. They switched authentication to Elytron, so you need to change host-slave.xml file.

- `RepresentationToModel` assumes importing entries. So it takes them as is - with no modifications.
- `updateUserFromRep` assumes you're creating or updating a User, so it applies hell amount of defaults. This method also manipulates user's email and its username a lot. 
- Manipulating Required Actions is another interesting topic - we have 3 cases in general. Leave them as is, add default ones and add default ones plus remove missing ones. That's just too complex.
- Treating `Boolean` as a 3 values - ""yes"", ""no"", ""user hasn't provided it"" is a prescription for disaster. I've been hunting for a test, which disabled my user for a few hours (!!!).
- We need to rebuild `UserTest`. None of the test methods performs a cleanup and adding a new test method is very problematic. If you change the order of invocation of the tests, they start to fail clashing on duplicated Client IDs or querying users from different tests. Implementing anything there is like walking on a mine field. 

I'll create another PR with a simplified implementation. ",1,1,prediction_comments_keycloak.csv

355,"@marekhalmo In my original comment, I mentioned I didn't want to us the Android/data directory (shared storage) because the files are deleted when the app is uninstalled. My preset files are saved as .json text files, so nothing too complicated. This used to work fine prior to Android 11, but now nothing works.

I was able to save/read files from the public documents folder initially, but if I uninstall and reinstall the app then I no longer have access to those files because the new installation was viewed as a ""different"" app. I wish there was a way to simply prompt the user to take ownership of that folder again, then I could continue using it as before. I don't understand why Android had to screw this up so badly, it shouldn't be difficult to ask the user before accessing a folder and then retain the permission so you only have to ask once.

I've got more ideas for features and apps allowing users to add their own audio files (I'm developing apps for musicians) and would prefer to share these files between apps instead of having multiple copies in each app's data directory since music files are larger files than text files and storage space can be very low on mobile devices.

I'm shocked using it for numerical approximation has been hiding in plain sight. Embarrassing imo.

On page 47 (50 in PDF) of Approximations it starts describing the Chebyshev polynomial method and then the subsequent minmaxing. Chebyshev is the starting ""guess"" for minmax because it's already so close and the non-evenly spaced sample points are ideal to avoid Runge's phenomena and spread the error evenly over the interval. The minmaxing can be done computationally in modern times with the Remez algorithm in just a few iterations.

Pro move is to find someone with MATLAB to use Chebfun and its Remez algorithm (that initially performs Chebyshev) for  whatever number of terms you want. I suspect it will be slightly / non-significantly better than Approximations book equations, but the book lacks cos, arccos and tan.

FWIW, in scene2d Stage `cancelTouchFocusExcept` cancels touches for this reason by simulating a touch up, similar to this PR. It's a bit hacky, but I couldn't come up with a less clumsy way of doing it. Sometimes listeners need to know if the touch up was actually for cancelling focus. To do that InputEvent has to do this magicke nasty:

3508,"@NathanSweet Thanks for the answer but I think the devil is in the details so let's go back to the specific example of `format`. Currently if set to `RGBA8888` on libGDX TexturePacker it will not output it because it's a default. 

First question is:  where is this default value for `format` defined exactly so that libGDX sets it to `RGBA8888` when missing on the atlas? I would expect all defaults from the parser in one place.

My second question was about opening on another 3rd party tool such as Texture Packer Pro a new texture atlas generated with libGDX Texture Atlas that doesn't have the `format` defined or other key properties, would it work? Probably not. And same problem occurs for current code that relies on the current format. Making important properties like `format` optional and not outputting them when value is default we are breaking backwards compatibility in some cases just to skip 1 line.

IMO having everything optional doesn't make it a good file especification, it makes life harder for 3rd party integrations or custom extensions that expect some minimal stuff to be there and breaks backwards compatibility for minimal gain. I think if we  define what is required and what is not we would have the benefits of both skipping the properties that are really optional (like `index`) and take a lot of space while keeping bakwards compatibility in most cases and 3rd party integration support (and as an extra we get file validation).

3890,"No problem pinging me. Table working correctly is very important!

The first screenshot is very blurry and I don't know what I'm looking at. The second I can see the undo and redo buttons are very tall, which I guess is unwanted. I can't tell what else might be placed incorrectly, but it probably wouldn't help determine why the bad layout happened anyway.

How you are configuring the table doesn't look odd at all. The recent changes to Table were mostly about how rounding is performed, but I don't see how they could cause such wildly incorrect layouts. I'm afraid we probably can't do much without being able to reproduce the problem. Even if I had a good guess at the cause, which I unfortunately don't, without being able to reproduce it we couldn't know if that really fixed it.

Maybe it happens only at specific sizes? Have you tried running your app as a desktop app where you can resize the window?

What coordinates do you use for your stage? Eg, do you use a ScreenViewport where 1 pixels is 1 unit in the stage, or something else?

Maybe there is something weird on those devices with rounding? I hate to blame it on a hardware specific failure because it seems so unlikely. If you don't already, you could try disabling rounding via Table `setRound(false)`. Or to narrow it down to the rounding and not the other, supposedly minor Table changes, you could modify Table so rounding is not done during layout, and is instead done after layout like it used to be. However, effort is probably better spent trying to make a reproduction case so we can be sure about a fix.

@RUSshy I make commits to `master` when I feel the changes don't need input from others, otherwise I create a PR. `master` is a development branch and changes made there may be unstable. Users who run from a development branch are helping to find issues and improve the library. That is a very useful thing, quite unlike your complaining.

3899,"```
table.add(button).height(button.getHeight() * 0.75f);
```
The button's height will be the pref height, so it could be that is too large for some reason. Maybe you could print the height or similar so we can know what that height was when the layout is weird? Might be hard since Android doesn't make getting the log output easy.

TextButton has a Label, so the problem could be in Label or GlyphLayout or BitmapFont. Or DistanceFieldFont or gdx-freetype -- how do you create your fonts? Otherwise TextButton is a Button is a Table, so the problem could still be Table, either the button/table itself or the table the button is placed in. It seems nuts for the devices to be just completely wonky.

Your label wraps but the button height is computed in the TextButton constructor, before `setWrap(true)`. Even if the height were computed after, the wrapping label's pref width is 0, and GlyphLayout `setText` turns off wrapping for very narrow widths. I don't think the label wrap matters.

Something to note is that you change the padding on the label's cell, but:
1) Changing table constraints don't invalidate the layout. You should call `table.invalidate()` after changing table/cell constraints.
2) The button's height is set in the constructor to the pref height, so won't reflect your table constraint changes made later, even if you call `invalidate`. If you care about that, you could it like this:
```
TextButton textButton = new TextButton(text, textButtonStyle);
textButton.getLabel().setWrap(true);
textButton.getCell(textButton.getLabel()).pad(0, 4, 0, 4);
textButton.invalidate(); // let the table know its size and layout needs to be recomputed
textButton.pack(); // equivalent to setSize(getPrefWidth(), getPrefHeight()) then validate()
return textButton;
```
If the button is already placed in another actor, you'd probably want to call `invalidateHierarchy()` if you changed the table constraints, so all the parent actors to the root know their layout needs to be recomputed.

BTW, you can use TextButton `getLabelCell` instead of `getCell(label)`.",1,1,prediction_comments_libgdx.csv

FWIW, we could set the defaults from Java rather than rely on whatever Box2d uses for defaults.

> If we return the Fixture's Filter instance to the user and modifies it, it is causing an inconsistency between internal/native Box2D and Java states.

Yep. My general theory for similar things is that if it's easy to make the API safe, do it. If doing that is awkward, a little gotcha is usually not a huge problem. It's impossible to keep a user from screwing things up and putting too much effort into making it idiot proof is usually not a good investment. There are similar situations elsewhere, eg scene2d.ui List `getItems`, Batch `getColor`, or others.

> An alternative if we accept breaking backwards compatibility is to make Filter immutable.

When things make sense to be immutable, it's great. Otherwise it tends to be a whole lot of jumping through hoops (and allocations).

When unit tests are an excellent option, they are often checking non-subjective, non-perceptual things, like ""Was an Exception thrown and uncaught during routine data structure manipulation?"" or ""Does the name entry validation function reject the empty string as a name?"" Sometimes these need OpenGL to check, like when examining errors in shader compilation, but many more OpenGL issues need to be caught on corner-case hardware than can be caught on one machine with invisible graphics.

Subclassing a node is done using `CustomNode extends BaseNode<CustomNode>`, which is a little odd. When _not_ using a custom tree node, we need to avoid the type `Node` from being a raw type, else existing code would break and you'd need to use `Node<Node>`, which is stupid looking. So we'll need to use an abstract class and declare Node using `Node extends BaseNode<Node>`.

Unfortunately existing code will break, but at least it is minimal. You will need to change:

Tree tree = new Tree();

I haven't tried the line change at line 230 in OpenALMusic, because I wasn't able to compile the backend project(dependency hell). 
Anyway, I noticed that some songs take longer to play than others, so this issue is not always present. I haven't compared the songs that have longer play startup with the shorter ones.

I can live with the current situation. Still think there should be an easy way to set a looping point though. So if there are no plans to implement a looping point feature, this ticket should be closed.

I've worked around this for now with this (rather ugly) kludge:

```java
// Hack - custom text field for OSX arrow key character codes
TextField textField = new TextField(value, skin){
    @Override
    protected InputListener createInputListener() {
        return new TextFieldClickListener() {

On Windows 10, there is a feature called UI Scaling described in this article: https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/4597/windows-10-feature-focus-display-scaling

This is a good feature for people with vision problems to make the text and GUI elements bigger in most Windows programs.

However, when this feature is enabled, two very bad things happen for libGDX:

1. In full screen mode, we only see the upper left portion of the viewport zoomed in according to the degree of the UI scaling.

2. Nearest Neighbor pixel rendering screws up and shows blurry pixels instead of sharp edges. (this becomes easier to see with Windows Magnifier, but it's happening and it's nasty)

I have confirmed this by running my program with UI scaling turned off (it works perfect) then turning UI scaling on. (these bad effects happen)

This feature first started on Windows XP but programmers only started having to worry about it when Windows 7 started trying to scale up apps that didn't tell the newer Windows API that they were DPI-aware. I believe that is what the problem is for libGDX. As InfoWorld says, ""For apps that aren't high-DPI aware, Microsoft has a quick and dirty fix called DPI virtualization. Windows deliberately reports the wrong DPI resolution to such apps, so their elements render as if they were on a lower-resolution display. The results are then zoomed to fit the current display."" http://www.infoworld.com/article/2952506/microsoft-windows/high-resolution-displays-reveal-windows-10-blind-spot.html

What needs to be done to fix this is to make Windows builds of libGDX apps DPI-aware, as discussed in this article from Microsoft https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn469266(v=vs.85).aspx and explained in this tutorial. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd464659(v=vs.85).aspx

Here is a really good blog post about the issue: http://www.hanselman.com/blog/LivingAHighDPIDesktopLifestyleCanBePainful.aspx

If you'd like to see my code, here is the commit I tested this effect on: https://github.com/BenMcLean/badroguelike/commit/31afc8fdba22180d9b9d47b5a9fd8aaf2417a516

As a temporary workaround, libGDX game developers can turn off UI scaling before running the libGDX apps, then turn it back on afterwards to write code, and players can check the ""Disable display scaling on high DPI settings"" check box under ""Compatibility"" in the Properties for the app. But that is a real pain to deal with and DPI-awareness is a necessity for Windows apps now.",1,1,prediction_comments_libgdx.csv

12320,"@jacksondus the code has a severe C legacy, so it's naming convention is mostly C. Still, `String` is just an immutable wrapper for `char[]` - you won't see `String` used as a base type anywhere in any serious tokenizer/lexer, since the most basic data struct appearing there is a single `char`, and using wrappers in tight processing always incurs a severe penalty.

To be able to do any real tokenization/parsing/lexing, you'll need a properly constructed state machine. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragel (suggested by @davebaol) is indeed a very stable and quite standard solution, easy to implement and maintain. Alternatively, you can use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaCC , http://www.antlr.org/ or any other similar tool.

If you're using regexes, both the extend of your lexical analysis and the performance will suffer.

Creating and maintaining own lexical/syntactical analysis framework is IMO just asking for development hell and Yet Another Abandoned Project, unless you have a couple of good & experienced developers willing to work a couple of years for free. If you don't have that but want to create a versatile solution, usable to any person other than yourself - I'd suggest to reconsider your current approach. I linked to my repo mostly to show you that while creating such tools is obviously possible, _it's easier to use a more standard-compliant solution when working on any serious project with anyone other than yourself._ Otherwise, anybody other than yourself (and possibly you after a couple of months) will have the same **WTF** moment as you have while looking at _my_ code.

Also, respectfully, I don't get why you have to call my attempts at finding a solution as ""pretending"". I get that you are a major contributor to LibGDX, and I'm also aware it was you who authored this part of the code.

@NathanSweet , Alright, I guess its just my thought that not adjusting the origin after a setSize causes the origin to now be inaccurate, and potentially out of the area of the visible sprite/image.

I guess could I suggest at least adding some sort of comment in any examples or on any wiki pages, that setSize will not adjust the origin?  It may be obvious to those that understand it, and wrote it, but for those who are using it for the first time it may not be.

I think my confusion stems from using XNA and how they defined and interacted with sprites.  Most positioning was done via the center of the image with XNA if you set the origin.

If that is working as designed then I agree, close this issue.

Also, I fixed all my rotation issues from my misunderstandings on how the sprite class methods worked.

assetManager.load(""default.atlas"", TextureAtlas.class);

Making a valid SSCCE is enough to solve the problem in 90% of the cases, as far as my experience goes. Also, you haven't given any information _where_ is the exact `.play()`/`.loop()` that causes the issue for you is. By not supplying the required information and not adhering to SSCCE guidelines, you're making solving the issue harder for everyone, including yourself, as well as being borderline rude vs people trying to help you. If you can't be bothered to make a valid SSCCE for the code you want to get fixed, probably not many people will want to be bothered with fixing your code.

a) what I posted is, obviously, on topic, because I have had issue with a fix to the issue I reported,

I would add that I did not reintroduce the loading of selected face in FacedCubeMap. This is due to a design question that I have : to handle setting face from FileHandle, we have to be able to instantiate TextureData from FileHandle. Currently there is a helper method in GLTexture (createTextureData) that deduce and create the correct TextureData. To implement correctly in FacedCubeMap, I would have to duplicate these which is not satisfying. On the design part, I do not feel that GLTexture should be the place for this TextureData factory method. So my question ;
- do I leave it like this (setting a face in a facedcubemap being a minor requirement ?),
- do I duplicate the code (ugly no ?),
- do I add a TextureDataFactory or something like this, that the GLTexture.createTexture would reference (and mark as deprecated),
- do I just make public the static factory method of GLTexture and use it.

What do you think ?

1) With setContinuouseRendering(false) set, no touches or gestures are detected.  (That is, until I click the home button and come back into the app, it seems everything that was backlogged happens at once, but I still can't touch anything again.)

Also, a second issue:

2) With setContintinuousRendering(true) and calling requestRendering() at the end of the main render() loop, the app never gets past the launch image.  I would assume requestRendering() while rendering is already enabled is screwing something up, probably needs a check if rendering is enabled and if so, to not do anything.

```
// Turn on non-continuous rendering when countdown reaches 0.
countdownToNonContinuous -= Gdx.graphics.getDeltaTime();
if (countdownToNonContinuous <= 0)
{
    System.out.println(""Non-continuous rendering starting now."");
    countdownToNonContinuous = Float.MAX_VALUE;
    Gdx.graphics.setContinuousRendering(false);
}
```

I had countdownToNonContinuous set for 1 second, though I'm sure the issue probably occurs after  just 1 frame of continuous rendering.

16541,"> So, the issue is that you don't want to use Buffer#position(int) to set the position in the buffer where you want to copy to (which is how it is intended) and instead want to manually specify that position as argument of the method? Can you explain why using Buffer#position is an issue?

All right. Forget about the position/limit thing. Focus on the BufferUtils.copy method I quoted on my last comment.

That call computes the srcOffset in bytes directly, which is great, computes the numElements in btyes directly, which is also great, but does that ugly BufferUtils#positionInBytes(int) call inside that can be avoided IF the user knows what kind of buffer he is passing to the method.

What I want is a new method that lets me pass the offsets by myself.

For example:

```
public void updateBuffer ( RenderInstance item ) {
FloatBuffer view = tmpBuffer.view;
Spatial sp = item.spatial;
view.put( sp.mvpTransform.array );
view.put( sp.mvTransform.array );
}
```

Used like:

```
for ( RenderInstance item: renderInstances )
    updateBuffer(item);
```

That's updating a buffer before uploading to an UBO. Transforms are sequentially stored in the buffer in the form of { mvp1, mv1, mvp2, mv2, mvp3, mv3, ... mvpx, mvx }.

Closest replacement with BufferUtils would be:

```
FloatBuffer view = tmpBuffer.view;
Spatial sp = item.spatial;
BufferUtils.copy( sp.mvpTransform.array, 0, 16, view);
view.position( view.position() + 16 );
BufferUtils.copy( sp.mvTransform.array, 0, 16, view);
view.position( view.position() + 16 );
```

Inside those BufferUtils.copy calls there is that BufferUtils#positionInBytes(int) call which goes a long if/else chain to get the actual offset.

Instead I could just do:

```
FloatBuffer view = tmpBuffer.view;
Spatial sp = item.spatial;
int offsetInBytes = view.position() << 2;
BufferUtils.copy( sp.mvpTransform.array, 0, 16, view, offsetInBytes);
view.position( view.position() + 16 );
offsetInBytes += 64; // 16 floats * 4 bytes each.
BufferUtils.copy( sp.mvTransform.array, 0, 16, view, offsetInBytes);
view.position( view.position() + 16 );
```

No more needless branching because I already know the actual offsets.

BufferUtils.copy implementation would be just like the one I commented above:

```
public static void copy(float[] src, int srcOffset, int numElements, Buffer dst, int dstOffsetBytes ){
copyJni(src, srcOffset << 2, dst, dstOffsetBytes, numElements << 2);
}
```

No need for BufferUtils#positionInBytes(int) anymore.

> Please note that if we would add the method signature as you suggested, that will probably cause confusion, because e.g. srcOffset and numElements is specified in number of floats (in your example) and dstOffsetBytes in bytes.

That's why its called dstOffsetBytes. You can't possibly know what Buffer actual class is, unless you do a long if/else chain of instanceof as most BufferUtils methods do. So the next best thing is directly specifying the offset in bytes. The user of the method probably will know what kind of buffer is passing to the method, so he can compute the offset in the spot without branching needlessly.

In any case, I've already found that BufferUtils.copy works terribly slow for my use case. So I might just put everything in a float[] and do a single put(float[]) call on the buffer, or see if in that case BufferUtils.copy works better (then the positionInBytes won't be a problem since it will be called few times).

You only need to dispose a `Shape` if you (or some third-party library) created it in Java code (i.e. with `new CircleShape()` or something).  If you call `fixture.getShape()`, you do NOT need to `dispose()` the resulting `Shape`; in fact, don't do so, you'll crash your game.

`Shape`s are copied into the relevant `Fixture` after you create it, though.  So if you have a bunch of `Fixture`s that use the same `CircleShape` (regardless of whether or not they use the same `FixtureDef`), after you create all those `Fixture`s you can delete the `CircleShape` you used.  Or keep it around for the future if you'd like.

Then I started experimenting with GWT using reflection to implement the common API. Unfortunately, I get the compile error `Only class literals may be used as arguments to GWT.create()` 
due to the fact that I have to use something like `GWT.create(type.getClassOfType())` instead of  `GWT.create(MyBundle.class)` since I don't know the class at compile-time but only the class name at run-time. So the error is pretty clear, it's a limitation imposed by GWT itself.
I've googled a bit searching for a solution and I only found complex tricks about generators, deferred binding,.... Damn, I'm confused, it sounds too advanced for my current GWT skills. :confused:

@titovmaxim, positioning based on origin may be useful, but I think it complicates Sprite a bit. It's not so hard to add the origin when setting the position if that is what you want.

Not a fan of the overrides. Eclipse shows me an override icon in the margin without the need for a big annotation in my face, for nearly every method. It is noise that only helps when refactoring, which happens seldom or never. Even then it isn't a problem to refactor without overrides, especially when using refactoring tools.

Add a `setLogger` method to Application. Log methods can't be taken out of
Application without breaking things. Leave them and have them delegate to
the Logger (unless we do want to break the things). Each backend would have
Logger implementation that does whatever those methods do now.

not get to dictate how things are run around here. Nor does anyone working

As can be seen by you necromancing this issue after 8 years, it was easily
discoverable via a simple search for your specific problem. You could have
decided to ask for re-opening as you'd like to take on the issue since you
have an immediate need for a fix. You could have shown work arounds you
found that could be implemented and discuss the best approach to implement
the fix with maintainers before heading off and sending a PR.

Instead you come here with pompous entitlement, ignoring any and all
reasons why this issue may have been closed
8 fucking years ago, and also being entirely oblivious about how things
work around these parts. Because YOU have a booboo in your super important
project! Because YOUR issue is the most important issue in the world and it
is an afront that someone didn't anticipate YOUR need 8 years ago. How dare
those OSS maintainers!

You must not interact often with people, if you think they way you
introduced yourself here will yield a positive outcome.

People like you are the reason why OSS is ultimately a fools errand. Your
entitlement and disrespect is inversely proportional to your contributions
to this community. And sadly, there are more people like you than people
who actually take their time to get to know and participate in the
community surrounding an OSS project. Ultimately, this kind of shit
examplified here by you is why one loses any interest in doing this kind of
work (for free).

So, good luck getting more favorable responses from poor customer support
folks working on ""legitimate engines"" that can be ""taken seriously"" when
you send them an angry email about a ""Won't fix"" issue from 8 years ago for
a piexe of third party software that has been discontinued 5 fucking years
ago.

I was able to easily reproduce this issue with a simple SpriteBatch and a couple of lines of code. See RotationTest in the test suite. 

The issue is the shitty MathUtils.sin/cos methods which use a fucking idiot method of coming up with sine and cosine values. I pity the fool who wrote that and will take revenge!

Filtering is still an issue when using 0.5f offsets but i'll try to come up with a fix for that. Don't hold your breath though.

Hi there,

thanks for the patches. I patched Stage/Group accordingly (just renamed the methods to clear() in general). I also made all classes in the math package serializable (still missing the serial version uid in some cause my eclipse install fucks up). 

I can't comment on or patch the animation related things cause that's Dave's area. I forwarded him everything, i guess he'll get back to you at some point. He's currently in the crunch phase of his game so it might take a while.

thanks again, much appreciated!

We actually bind different touch handlers by checking the SDK string so you have multitouch on > 2.0 and single touch on <= 1.6. However, the call to PackageManager.hasFeature() is called naked in the wild, a shitty bug indeed. It was unnoticed as we did not call this method in any of our tests. I added a new test that checks for all potentially problematic methods.

I'm sorry this didn't get caught before you released your game to the market. While we try to have as good code coverage as possible we're still not there in the tests. I highly suggest to always test your app on 1.5, 1.6, 2.0(.1), 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 emulators. 

I went through all the Android backend to seek out any other problematic passages that invoke APIs > 1.5 (by setting the build target to 1.5) and couldn't find any other bollocks invocation. Again, sorry this didn't get caught in time. One liners can get lost pretty easily...

Concerning the lockless input event queue: I'm currently working on a modification that should bring down the latency of input events a little. Note however that it will still have a worst case latency of 16ms (or whatever your game can achieve) since it runs on the rendering thread which is vsynched on Android (no workaround possible). This could be fixed by making your game logic run on a separate thread which brings its own problems with it (synch with rendering thread still has to happen at some point so you can't totally escape the vsynch).

Again, sorry. I'll commit your patch later this evening.

Ack. why was I on my company login?

Ok. I know it's supposed to work with the sdk check, but I believe android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK returned 8 in my case due to building with the 2.2 SDK. I suspect that value is compiled in instead of accessed from the actual executing OS. Either way, it actually crashes when I tested on the 1.6 emulator with the exception saying hasSystemFeature method does not exist.

From now on, I'm resorting to testing all my final release on the emulator. Though it really sucks that emulator runs hell slow and is impossible to even properly test them except for trying to start them up. I can't even play word zen on the emulator! ___ Personally, I'm glad that libGDX actually have a desktop build to allow me the ease of testing the game logic and rendering before delving into the emulator which is impossible to develop on.

line 181: I'm only allocating when I cannot find any unused KeyEvent from the pool. The event pool is replenished when processEvents() is called. So it's actually doing a pool system only that it's outside and a little hackish.

Reproduceable on Ubuntu 9.10, 32-bit using 1.6.0_15 Sun Java. WHAT. THE. FUCK.

I'm directly using the Swing MouseListener and MouseMotionListener interfaces to report any input events. The code on all desktop platforms is the same. There seems to be a difference in how repeat keys are handled on Windows and Linux in Swing. 

On Windows repeat keys are reported as simply down/typed events. On Linux they seem to be reported as up/down/typed. So this bug must have existed since day one as i never changed the way i handle Swing keyboard events. That is pretty fucked up. And given that a down event is reported on Linux i'm also now sure how i could filter those events. I can't decide whether a key event is due to a repeat key or is an original key event.

I'll look into this. For now i just don't see a solution which would reproduce the behaviour on Windows. Open for suggestions.

I'm well aware of the problem. Instead it is a bit more complicated even. See http://apistudios.com/hosted/marzec/badlogic/wordpress/?p=537 . The sleep alone does not solve all problems, especially when one of your heavy duty threads is doing a shitload of work. I'm also a bit baffled by the fact that you run a 2.0.1 ROM on your device and still get it. The situation has become a bit better with the 2.x releases and we were hoping that this would also work on 1st gen devices. Seems like it doesn't :/. 

Anyways, i'll add a second AndroidApplication.initialize() method which allows you to specify a sleep time for the input event handler.

Well, the only thing that can be done is using another HashMap implementation (apart from changing the architecture which is as good as i can do it atm). Sun's HashMap is a bit of a bitch as it wraps objects that get stored in it via Entry instances. So this alone adds overhead memory wise and might put pressure on the GC. However, fixtures are mostly static unless you destroy and create new bodies plus fixtures often (which you don't do if you are wise :). So the GC will barely if ever run during normal game play. That was my intuition when using HashMaps in this scenario. Now, the performance hit of calling HashMap.get() is something i don't quiet understand. It might be that the Android implementation is a bit of a bitch (like many other standard lib classes on Android). There are options out there which have far better performance. The one i use at work for highperformance computing stuff is called Trove, http://trove4j.sourceforge.net/ which allows hashing with primitive keys without all the boxing and wrapping. It also uses another mechanism internally to store the entries. The problem is that trove is huge and would add twice the size libgdx currently has. Extracting only the necessary parts is not possible due to license issues. I'll do a bit of research tomorrow and will hopefully find an alternative (Colt's open hashmaps could be of help). Another avenue to improve the performance is to get rid of looking up Fixture instances in the World.contactFilter and use preallocated Fixture instance instead. Don't get your hopes up high though i don't think we'll get any significant boost out of either modification.

Btw, want to get on the team and become the performance master? :)

A little bit ugly: don't save the raw values in the array but `value / values.length`. You still have a little inaccuracy when you want to get a certain value (`values[i] * values.length`), but this error is not accumulated into the nirvana.

23886,"So, all iPhones up to the 3GS had a  320 × 480 display with 163 dpi. The iPhone 4 and 4S have a screen resolution of 640x960 at 326dpi, so everything is pretty much just double, which is easy to scale. The iPhone 5 however has a resolution of 1136 x 640 at 326dpi, it's essentially an iPhone 4/4S with more vertical space. That's all nice and dandy, as you only need two versions of your assets, one for 163 dpi, and one for 326 dpi. If i were to design UIs for this for a game, i'd probably design (and code) at 320x480, with relative placement of buttons etc, to cope with the iPhone 5. Btw, does the iPhone 5 report 320x480 when not using the scaling? Because that would be fucking weird.

If i were to add iPad support, i have to deal with 1,024×768 at 132 dpi, and 2,048×1,536 at 264 dpi. I would have to design an entirely new UI for this and can't reuse the iPhone stuff.

I end up with 2 UI designs, each scaling to normal and retina easily, and if my app is universal, i ship 4 sets of assets. The increased vertical space on the iPhone 5 sucks in this regard, i might have to ship special images that make up the background of a UI screen for example, to account for the additional space.

How would i cope with Android? I'd argue that for actual game graphics, one would most likely just ship ldpi, mdpi, hdpi and xhdpi resources. Different aspect ratios can either be coped with through stretching (usually ugly) or showing more/less of the game world depending on the ratio (potential advantage for devices with ""better"" ratios. Starcraft 2 actually stretches for that reason!). A little scaling and linear filtering looks pretty good almost all of the time for 2D games. 3D games don't suffer as much from non-pixel-perfect rendering anyways. 

What about the UIs? We have to special case for iPhone vs. iPad already on iOS. We can do the same on Android using ldpi,mdpi,hdpi, xhdpi. Relative positioning/sizing of UI elements helps coping with different aspect ratios. Yes, it is twice the work.

I actually coped with Android's screen ""mess"" a couple of times already. All my sizes/positions/velocities for UIs are expressed in dips. I have 4 or 5 methods that translate those dips into pixel coordinates based on the current device's dpi. Those methods are only used when i create the widgets of my UI. I never use them to convert touch coordinates or anything else, that's what i use camera's for. 

That method worked very well for me, without a lot of artifacts. Granted though, i used gdx-freetype to generate pixel perfect fonts. Doing this with prerendered BitmapFonts is not possible. It only works on iOS because of their fancy @2x trick (which i predict they won't be able to pull of for a lot longer, iPad Mini...).

My fear is that people start with iOS, forgetting about Android. I argue that if you come up with a mechanism that works on Android, you automatically have a mechanism. By introducing the scale factors for iOS we kinda give the impression that that's how you handle things, were in reality that only works if your device set is as restricted as the iOS devices (@2x). It's a band aid, not a solution to the real problem.

However, the config flags are super non-intrusive. I think they should be set to 2.0 by default, so we get the same results as on Android devices, forcing people to think about screen densities.

I think that the subject we are talking about is enough difficult and it looks to me that we really differently understand how things work :)

So, as far as I understand:

0. **Sync** code is better than **Async**. **Reactive/Event Loop** model is complicated and is kinda ad-hoc solution to the **C10K+** problem. My personal preference would be to write plain straight simple **Sync** code, without callbacks, futures, promises, async/await syntax.

1. **Async/Await** is a syntax sugar for using **Futures/Promises**. Which are it turn the solution for **Callback Hell**. All of this is related to **Reactive/Event Loop** model and **Async** code, and has nothing to do with **Loom** and **Sync** code.

2. **Loom** enables **Sync** code to be usable for **C10K+** problems. If you're familiar with **Go** and **Goroutines**, I see **Loom** as almost exact copy. It gives you **Fibers**, as a lightweight replacement of **Threads**. So you can start 100'000s of **Fibers** to handle **C10K+** cases.

3. With **Loom** you'll be able to write **Sync** code, which will work just fine in **C10K+** cases, won't consume a lot of memory, won't suffer from context switches, etc. In general, it will have all the advantages which **Go** and **Goroutines** now have in 2019.

4. Here's an example of **Sync** pseudo-code I'm talking about. Notice that there're no callbacks, event loops, futures, promises or async/await syntax:

```
var serverSocket = new ServerSocket(80);
while(true) {
  var s = serverSocket.accept();
  (new Fiber() {
    void run() {
      var reqBytes = s.readBytes();
      var resBytes = someProcessing(reqBytes); // Blocks and takes significant time amount
      s.writeBytes(resBytes);
    }
  }).start();
}
```

5. With **Loom** the above code scales for **C10K+** cases. But today, we don't have **Loom** and if we switch **Fiber** to **Thread** - everything will still work, but will scale only for 100+ simultaneous users maximum, not a lot.

6. And yes, probably you can add **Loom** support to **Netty**, and use **Fibers** and **Continuations** ... but why?? If you use **Netty**, anyway you're kinda forced into **Reactive/Event Loop** model and **Async** code, which has all the cons described above.",1,1,prediction_comments_netty.csv

2451,"> We have different jobs setup that use different system property to run with different code-path. That said this is not optimal so maybe using something like Randomized Runner may be a better solution. Could this fit for this ?

I strongly recommend this, they should be equivalent thought. We @ elasticsearch use the Lucene test framework which adds a bunch of nasty utils on top of randomized runner. It's a game changer but be prepared to spend weeks until your codebase is ready to run. it's very very picky.

> No we not run the tests with a security manager. Honestly the elastic search people are the first one ever that reported any issues with netty when running with a security manager. It seems like most people not use a security manager at all. This comment is not to say that it would be a bad idea to run with one, just that there was no demand for this yet.

I am convinced that there is no demand because nobody uses it, but it's like a chicken egg problem. If you really wanna use it you gotta fix all shit upstream everywhere since nobody cares. I personally think it's a libraries responsibility to play nice with stuff like this especially since it prepares you well for java 9 and jigsaw. All your set accessible will fail :)

It's not like they would be insta removed when channel is dead, because EventLoop tasks are a linked list, so they would be removed when EventLoop catches up.
So my interpretation here is that EventLoop is having _terrible_ problems catching up because of CPU usage.

Totally agree: I suppose at this point that the benchmark needs to be redesigned to account of it...or maybe not :P

The whole point of this benchmark was to measure/observe the ""user experience"" and that's what a user would experience indeed; if that's obtained by luck (of timing) that's an implementation detail of the EL.
 
The point is that it's not providing all the means to observe other important scenarios (eg EL completely asleep) and I think that the benchmark need to provide a way to linger before the burst execution in order to observe how different lingering time would affect it (by using `BlackHole::consumeCPU` before the bench method invocation). 
As you have noticed that implies using `Level.Invocation` on the lingering method, but that means that measuring single burst scenarios is kinda screwed up on many *nix box due to `System::nanoTime` precision, no idea on MacOSX...
I've no idea yet how to solve it without using `Level.Invocation` on the lingering method, maybe summoning @nitsanw would help, given that [this benchmark](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/cd3254df88b60476dc04b39915d3d70c200eb6f4/microbench/src/main/java/io/netty/microbench/concurrent/BurstCostExecutorsBenchmark.java) has a lot in common with something on JCtools.

While re the multi threaded case I believe that the issue is different and was explained on https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9078: the multi producer case is not correctly awaiting the whole burst to be executed ie for that specific benchmark would be better to drop the multi producer support and create a new one that account for it correctly (WIP for me).",1,1,prediction_comments_netty.csv

It'd be nice if `SslContext` was an interface (or had one). That way it'd be safe to ""bastardize"" it and make it do whatever the user likes. It being an abstract class subjects the user to runtime breakage which puts me at unease of using the delegate pattern (hence the ticket).

An another idea could be to break the direct dependence on `SslContext` and introduce a little indirection. Something like this:

```java
interface SslContextHandle {
  SslContext sslContext();
}

// Default behavior, user may implement their own
class DefaultSslContextHandle implements SslContextHandle {
  private final SslContext sslContext;

2. A client presents an untrusted certificate to the server.
3. The server recognizes that the certificate is bogus, but allows the connection to happen anyway.

30813,"OK, decided to dig and see who's calling the InternalLoggerFactory in the first place (see Thread dump below).

It's Spring Boot -> Log4j2 -> loading its config (we use Clojure for that) which touches one of our classes which in turn touches a Netty class which in turn needs a Logger and ends up initializing the InternalLoggerFactory.

In our attempt to get our logging configuration in order and do it eagerly before anything else is up we end up shooting ourslves in the foot. But more importantly, at this point in our application's lifecycle it'd be still safe to change the InternalLoggerFactory but now we can't and we're stuck with this damn SLF4J binding (I'm really not happy about that).

```java
java.lang.IllegalStateException: factory is already set to [io.netty.util.internal.logging.Slf4JLoggerFactory@16aed49f], rejecting [io.netty.util.internal.logging.Log4J2LoggerFactory@66de00f2]
```

Again, I think the breaking change is good but it's also opinionated. You basically can't know how the user's application's lifecycle looks like. The only safe option is IMHO to give the user the opportunity to state upfront what their intention is and the easiest, safest and most straight forward thing seems to be System property.

```java

;; `com.squarespace.echo.bbb.Bbb` is referring to the Class and the
;; ClassLoader will touch it.
;;
;;
;; log4j.clj:104 - from the above Thread dump

```

```java
// We tried to configure the logging level of Bbb but it's also touching Aaa
class Bbb {
  private static final Logger LOG = LogManager.getLogger(Bbb.class);

  private static final Aaa AAA = new Aaa();
}

// This in turn touches AttributeKey which will eventually touch InternalLoggerFactory. Damn singletons.
class Aaa {
  private static final AttributeKey<T> ATTRIBUTE_KEY = AttributeKey.valueOf(Aaa.class, ""ATTRIBUTE_KEY"");

  void biz(Channel channel) {
    // uses ATTRIBUTE_KEY on Channel
  }
}
```

This is stuff is not an entry point to our Netty code. It's just random business code that happens to be referred in the log4j's configuration file and all I'm trying to do is to configure logging levels. The application's real initialization including doing things such as `new ServerBootstap().bind()` hasn't even happened yet...

Yes, if the CAS check wasn't there our Netty code would use along that codepath SLF4J and the change exposes the problem in our application as well. So that's good!

The ""we're not changing anything"" fix is to move the `InternalLoggerFactory.setLoggerFactory(Log4J2LoggerFactory.INSTANCE)` call before log4j's configuration stage. But that seems strange to me as well. It's arbitary to favor Netty's initialization over some other component and assumes it can be done in code and in a certain order.

The only agnostic/non-biased way to do it safely and 100% reliably is to configure it externally. A system property seems straight forward to me and aligns ""nicely"" with all the other properties that are required in a bigger application.

```java
java -Dlog4j.configurationFile=<path> \
  -Djava.util.logging.manager=org.apache.logging.log4j.jul.LogManager \
  -Dio.netty.logger.type=io.netty.util.internal.logging.Log4J2LoggerFactory
  ...
```

To summarize, I think 3c92f2b64a1c6803860ab310348abc9f1cb47ff4 is a good change but the underlying problem remains. Netty picks a Logger arbitarily simply because the ClassLoader is touching some Netty class and the user failed to land a `setLoggerFactory(...)` call prior to that. Worse, it's actually blowing up in the user's face and it doesn't really tell how it got into that state in the first place (I had to modify Netty to get that stack trace).",1,1,prediction_comments_netty.csv

I understand. That makes sense.

Yes, brain-fart on my side. Sorry 😅

I think that is a good option. I should be done in the bootstrap.

> That's concerning to me. I get really worried when I think about creating an Http2Stream without adding it to the trees that keep track of it. And if we do add it to the trees that keep track of it then now we will need synchronization lots of places, and I expect lots of code will become racy.

I am not sure I understand. I was suggesting to go back to attaching the channel as a property on the Http2Stream (which I removed in #5324) and not maintaining a map in `Http2MultiplexCodec`. The `Http2StreamFrames` would then have the channel attached. I think you had it that way originally?

> I had prepared things such that even Http2Stream wouldn't be necessary for Channel creation. Http2StreamChannel only used Http2Stream for notifying of consumed bytes, which would begin using WINDOW_UPDATES (using this as the stream id). Although you undid that preparation in #5324 (which is why I wasn't wanting you to swap from stream Objects).

Yes my change was a bit short sighted. Apparently I haven't thought it all through so well. I guess what I am proposing is to go back to that and have the channel on the `Http2StreamFrame`.

I guess I ll see in code how that all works out. Are you of the opinion that I should pursue the path of having a `Http2StreamBootstrap` or do you see some major disadvantage?

There has to be another problem related to a case when it can't write all at once, when I proxied 300 local bots, there was no more $Entries than 200 in total.
To manage read() calls without autoread(which would make things even worse), I depend on a following behaviour:

<s>[some packets waiting in the queue]
<s>flush a batch of packets ->

```
    handle.write(Unpooled.EMPTY_BUFFER, promise );
    handle.flush();
```

<s>(while the promise, when finished, will call read() on the other side of proxying connection)

<s>is it correct to expect that it will only get called after EVERYTHING before has been written to the socket? Another place when I could place the .read() is the flush(ChannelHandlerContext) method, but I think it's not a good place because it's just a ""request"" to flush.

<s>(note that when I created the bug there was no packet batching in the code so it would also writeAndFlush every packet. Now it looks like I ""just"" need a better place to call read() on the downstream after making sure that EVERYTHING has been written?)</s>

It does, just provide your own `Map` implementation (as is the case with the current headers implementation) or adopt a collections library that supports this.

> 1. use of newList() - Currently we are allocating an ArrayList to account for multiple values. Would a linked list make sense?

I think `ArrayLists` are just fine, at least I wouldn't see why not to use them. A `LinkedList` in Java is horrible! A two element `LinkedList` uses up exactly the same memory as a 10 element `ArrayList`. Even Josh Bloch doesn't use it https://twitter.com/joshbloch/status/583813919019573248 :smile: 

> I guess if we wanted to we could get rid of the comparators and use IntObjectMap.

I don't see why it makes sense to use an `IntObjectMap` for this. That's one of the reason why the current headers use so much memory. We would need an `ObjectToObjectMap`.

45899,"@buchgr @Scottmitch Moving this discussion to the main thread so it doesn't get lost.

I agree that it's ugly requiring the flow controllers to provide a `stateKey`.  After some thought, I'm starting to think that the problem here is one of data encapsulation ... i.e. by exposing the `FlowControlState`, we're breaking encapsulation and the separation of concerns between the Flow Controller and the application.  The application doesn't need to know that the Flow Controller is using a state object at all.

If the flow controller wants to expose the flow control window (or any other values that it associates with a stream), it should do so via a method `windowSize(Http2Stream)`, where internally it gets out the state property from the stream and returns the appropriate value.  If we do this, we can get rid of the `FlowControlState` interface entirely and have only `getProperty` and `setProperty`.  The Flow Controller will not need to expose its key, since it's the only one using it.

On AsyncHttpClient, I barely had any Android users, so I finally made the move of dropping JDK6, then JDK7 support. With JDK8, I can use things like ConcurrentHashMap#computeIfAbsent.

IMHO, Android is a different beast than standard Java, both in terms of:
- API (eg Java 7 like Android SDK misses some APIs, such as [SSLParameters.html#setEndpointIdentificationAlgorithm](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/SSLParameters.html#setEndpointIdentificationAlgorithm%28java.lang.String%29));
- concerns: on Android, you want lightweight, not low latency and super high throughput

It looks to me that OkHttp, which is tailor made for Android by the Square people, is a more natural fit in this space than Netty.

My opinion would be: drop Android, JDK 6 and 7 support, and focus on where Netty shines: on the server side.

Re: `io.netty.handler.codec.ByteToMessageDecoder.channelReadComplete()`

The code you mentioned is actually correct.  The intention here is to continue to read until at least one message is read completely.  Because `decode()` method returned `null` (i.e. decoded nothing and needs more data to finish decoding a whole message) _and_ auto-read is off, decoder has to call `ctx.read()` because otherwise the decoder will not be able to decode anything anymore.

The slight difference you've seen can be safely ignored.
Indeed, to arrive to this case, the first test is wrong:

```
 if (interval > AbstractTrafficShapingHandler.MINIMAL_WAIT && sum > 0) { 
```

Which means sum is 0 (impossible since sum just get the added proposed write bytes, so in fact this test is always true) or  interval is < MINIMAL_WAIT (10ms) (keep this one in mind)
Then the second one is false again:

```
if (lastNonNullWrittenBytes > 0 && lastNonNullWrittenTime + AbstractTrafficShapingHandler.MINIMAL_WAIT < now) {
```

which means last written bytes is nul or last time accounting was done is too close to ""now"" (less than 10ms)

Then interval might be null or at least < 10ms (shall not be <0, but in case we compute the absolute value).
Then the lastinterval compute is 10 to 19 at most.

One can consider it is too small/ridiculous, but in practice I observed that this difference is not at all needed in Read but can improve the Write traffic shaping. Whatever, this is not significant to imply a burst of 500 MB transfer in 10s for instance if you set 1 MB of limit (so 500s).

What kind of example do you have ?
Moreover, what version do you use (since this traffic was improve/corrected in the last versions 3.9, 4.0 4.1, and Master) ?

The primary purpose of AsciiString is to reduce the cost of writing a string constant into a ByteBuf.  Obviously, copying byte[] into ByteBuf is way faster than String into ByteBuf.

That being said, memory overhead was not a concern, but I agree that 12 ~ 16 byte overhead is relatively huge here.  Let me see what I can do.

I told him the fact that windows-select is crappy and he told me that this is not true anymore for Win7 & 8, which was really interesting for me.

I was reading http-codec related code, I am very confused, because I think the following code should never be executed.

            out.add(new DefaultHttpContent(readBytes(ctx.alloc(), buffer, toRead)));

Here is my derivation:

```
int toRead = (int) length - contentRead;
```

After executing the above code, we get: `length = toRead + contentRead`

```
        if (toRead > actualReadableBytes()) {
            toRead = actualReadableBytes();
        }
```

After executing the above code, we get: `length >= toRead + contentRead`

```
        contentRead += toRead;
```

After executing the above code, we get:  `length >= contentRead`

So `if (length < contentRead)` can not be met, the if code block become dead code.

57053,"The biggest problem with providing built-in string access operations is its diverse use cases.  For example:
- reading & writing a boundless string with a terminator - e.g. 'hello\0' when writing 'hello'
- reading & writing a bounded string with a terminator - e.g. 'hell' when writing 'hello' into 4-byte field

To handle all these cases we have to provide two flavors of access operations: variable-length field and fixed-length field.

When reading a variable-length string field, a user should specify:
- the maximum number of bytes to decode for security
- the terminator character which defaults to `\0` (terminator can also be disabled just in case a user wants to read `\0` and beyond)

When reading a fixed-length string field, a user should specify:
- pretty much same with reading a variable-length string field but read\* methods should increase the readerIndex differently because a user specifies 'the length of the field' rather than 'the maximum length of the field.'

When writing a variable-length string field, a user should specify:
- the maximum number of bytes to encode.  If the last character is multi-byte and the whole bytes cannot be encoded, it should stop filling the maximum number of bytes
- No need to specify the terminator character - a user can just write it separately.

When writing a fixed-length string field, a user should specify:
- the length of the field
- the padding character which defaults to `\0` (e.g. 'h\0\0\0' when writing 'h' into a 4-byte field)

All operations also should provide a way to tell the caller:
- how many bytes/characters were consumed and how many characters/bytes were produced.

A couple other nitpicks:
- I wish to see the read operations that accept a `StringBuilder`.
- How about just renaming `*CharSequence` to `*String`?  `CharSequence` is correct strictly speaking but we all know that it's a 'string' in general terms rather than being a class name.

Is there a reason it should not be possible to stream ByteBufs, only writing the next one when the last one is sent, _without_ using chunked encoding?

I can hack around this by wrappering the response's HttpHeaders in my own implementation which selectively ignores calls to set the transfer encoding, and everything works then, but it's really ugly.

How would you determine the life cycle of the channel?  UDP has no notion of opening and closing a connection.  MINA mimics a TCP-ish connection by triggering the disconnect event when no packet is received from the remote address for a while.  In Netty, I can essentially do the same:
1. channelConnected() when the first packet from a peer
2. channelDisconnected() when your handler calls disconnect() or close() explicitly or the connection is idle for pretty long time such as 5 minutes.

If a user wants complete control over the life cycle of the channel, idleness timeout could be set to a very large value and he or she could call disconnect() or close() (if forgot, screwed :-)).

Edit 4: I forgot to mention: the thumbnail when using Invidious is smaller. It doesn't reach the device edges. There are white/black (based on theme) bars on either side of it. Switching to YT loads the same thumbnail properly.

1750,"Quoting [rfc7845](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7845):

> The RECOMMENDED filename extension for Ogg Opus files is '.opus'.

As this is only a recommendation, I'd prefer to stick to `ogg` because OGG is a somewhat common audio container format that people know and the most widely used file extension for it is `ogg`, no matter the inner codec.

I'm also doubtful that the crappy music players people love to use can handle the `opus` extension well (despite Android 10) while I'd expect most of them to be able to handle `ogg`.

What do you think of an audio format option to save files as `webm` that gets enabled by default when the initial run happens on Android <7?  
Default with that option off would be `ogg`.

5892,"So I worked myself into this a bit further, and what i found out is, that accessing files via Unix file system (`File` class) is not possible any more. Instead you would want to use the Android Storrage Access Framework, which comes with its on classes and methods to handle files.

### Uri instead of file names

So instead of filenames SAF uses Uri, to access files. What we would want to do in order to access SD card files is getting the Uri for the root directory, and cooncan the path to our file onto the end of it.

### InputStream/OutputStream

Files can not be handled with `File` class anymore, however from android we can request InputStream/OutputStreams and create/delete fiels.

### gigaget

Our current download manager is bad rubbish, it's old code someone wrote to test his andorid skills, and therefore its not quite reliable and up to date. Also it is based ontop of the idea that you can download one file with parallel threads.

What I've seen so far is that there is no real replacement for a download manager that uses SAF on android arsenal (notify me if you find something different).

So we have two options here:
1. Refactor gigaget, so it does not use threads, and supports SAF
2. Write a downloadmanager from scratch

### File picker

Our filepicker is cool, but it does also not use SAF, and on top of that its sometimes a big buggy, here it would be cool to use the android SAF file picker, but that is not relay usable until android 6.0 ... so meh, we need to stick to it, and try to translate from filepath to uri.",1,1,prediction_comments_newpipe.csv

""Activity Stub"" is a default handler and it displays the message seen on third image. The same applies to the YT link to get subscriptions for myself.

Also note this has impact on how long you can go outdoors and listen to the music however I havent tested it yet, but i will test it ASAP.

15865,"Yeah, some of my chemistry, biochemisty, and nuclear professors and doctors that I follow on youtube have been getting strikes and kicked off of youtube because they are finding solutions to problems that is ahead of the regulators in power, including the cdc.

The youtube moderators are way out of their depth, and turning everything into a political discussion, including science and simple library newspaper research into old news articles that is ahead of their own world, political views.  

If the youtube moderators are so antiscience and simple minded, that they want to yank their own platform for an openforum where brainstorming and truth can rise to the top  (for example, in any debate between a physicist and a 911 conspiracy expert, the physicist always wins. And, it is very important that the questions that the 911 conspiracy expert be raised.), then, I will be more confortable moving off of youtube as a user and to a platform that only censors hatred, violence, and keeps a family friendly atmosphere (this is not only because I have kids, but I do not have the time for vulgarity and do not think social media as appropriate for gratuitous sexual manipulation of traffic, where there are alternatives that can focus using that. Because, I view youtube and the likes as an idea exchange (learn to build a house with all aspects and intricacies covered by the right way, the wrong way as pointed out by some of the comments, and the alternative way of doing things).  Note that by doing something the wrong way, that youtuber might open up ideas for a better way of doing something which has never been thought of before.

Yes, it might be time to abandon youtube, if their moderators are knocking us back to the dark ages. 

Interestingly, one wing will always adhere to sex/drug idea freedom, while screaming disinformation when a political idea rubs them the wrong way and might require a deep personal inner change if proved true, while the other  world view would be willing to give up my vulgarity and sexual filters, if it meant allowing people with better ways to build the next car or house, beat disease, etc.  Of course, this is why parental filters were invented with varying strength levels. These filters deprived the viewer of content, not the creators, and not harming the forum in general.  Parental filters can be lowered or removed by the end user, if the end user feels useful content is being block.  There is no reason why a politically set moderator or user could not use those same controls to blind themselves from ideas that rock their world view that are now used to control various degrees of pornography and fictitious violence (like gratuitous violence and sex scenes in most of the Netflix-minus the shows they have for under age 8--  and other's streaming library)...  I write this, in hopes of widening and promoting truth for future generations, and awakening people to the new Spanish inquisition moderators that is killing science, in favor of a very chinese model of censorship to drive a very political agenda and kill off the opposition.  I am shocked that the newpipe team might buy into the empty argument of ""misinformation"", which is any information that you disagree with.  In truth, everyone, at every point in human history, has been both right and wrong about some things.  There is not one leader, not one vote, not one consensus, not one textbook, not one professor, not one science theory, not one doctor, not one panel of doctors, who have been right about everything.  In fact, History tells us, that they are usually wrong about most things, and their wrong ideas will take generations to over turn with a better theory, which can only happen if the better idea is allowed to be raised.   Censorship to blind one's self, or those around you, is just censorship, it is not ""misinformation"" suppression any more than it is is Truth suppression.  This is because History tells us that mere humans do not know the Final Truth.  None of us are smart enough--not alone, nor collectively.  This is why Physics is not the same in 1880 as 1980.  Nor is it the same in 2020.  Nor will it be that same in 2080.  Humanity, we know historically, has never had a handle on the truth. All we have is a forum of ideas, some of which hold up better to other to deep scrutiny--that is, if scrutiny and questioning is allowed. As questions arise and are explained, it either weakens or strengthens the consensus. But when you put up a panel of consensus censors (exactly how North Korea became a dictatorship by the Chairman of the Censorship board), the truth never comes out, while the chairman of the censorship board eventually derives absolute power, eventually having unlimited power.  Those on the outside call it a dictatorship (outside north korea), while those on the inside believe they are being sheltered from misinformation and dangerous ideas..... Yeah, by supporting other platforms, you are protecting youtube from being abused by moderators with very little regard for the scientific process and Critical thinking and discussion, as well as undue influence by money coming from political parties and foreign dictatorships (via companies dependent on those markets and cheap manufacturing centers which allow price undercutting).  There is every indication of these influences, which are not friendly in the slightest to Wester ideas of Constitutional Democracy or personal freedom. Rightly, or wrongly, this is were we are today. 

It is a sad day for me, 2 days ago, when a theoretical biochemisty mechanism discussion gets a youtube strike, because they are ahead of a China and big pharmaceutical company led panel throwing out limited recommendations that fall short of solving human health problems.  It shows a total ignorance of Scientific history.

This bug most likely has to do with two things:
- How they have rewritten the internals of FragmentManager in AndroidX Fragment [1.3.0](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/fragment#1.3.0).
- And AndroidX Fragment now uses AndroidX Lifecycle 2.3.1 internally as of [1.3.2](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/fragment#version_132_3), whereas NewPipe itself is still using 2.2.0.

I believe these are the source of this new bug (and may be the cause of possibly undiscovered new bugs as well).

There is likely some new behavior that NewPipe has not sufficiently accounted for, and that is the source of this bug. But, given all the weird shit we have to do around the app just to dispose of stuff properly when views and stuff are destroyed, I suppose this isn't surprising.

Google Takeout. But I just figured it out. I'm a bloody idiot. On Google Takeout my default account was selected and since it's VERY old and during the Google+ days my youtube account got separated from my original main google account (kinda a sub-account but linked with the original).

Why was @BartFarley's comment marked as ""disruptive comment"" when it is nothing but the truth? Please stop silencing / ignoring opinions that do not align with what you think. You did that to me as well when I was explaining why that feature was essential to me and was told by more than one of the devs that this function cannot be essential to me because **they** don't use it at all. (That was a little WTF-Moment for me to be honest)

Anyway, let's be constructive: I see that my suggestion to put the button toggling the auto-play function in a more prominent position has been implemented in the meantime. If someone could finally fix the list of upcoming videos to only contain the playlist items in an ordered fashion if a video was started from a playlist that would solve all the problems and make the play from here obsolete.

21879,"I think this is a terrible idea.  I can already tell when I come across false and misleading information.  It's called questioning everything and doing research.  It takes work, and there's no easy solution as simple as believing whatever Youtube says.  I don't need US tech companies doing my thinking for me.

The sources that companies like YT use to ""fact check"" are themselves highly dubious, obviously biased, highly political and propagandized, politically funded, and stuck in their filter bubbles.  Tech companies, media, academia, and so called independent entities and public organizations are frequently politically aligned, and this is not by accident.  They blatantly masquerade their confirmation bias circle jerking as critical discourse, and use it to quash legitimate critical thinking and healthy disseting views from reaching people.  On a plethora of important issues, the ""official"" fact checking has been legitimately contested by multiple respected sources and/or the original supporting data was cherry picked from inconclusive or disputed research (e.g. viability of solar/wind as eco-friendly primary energy sources, efficacy of masks), or outright debunked as false and politically motivated (e.g. efficacy of lockdowns in preventing infection or death, COVID danger to children or young teachers attending school, climate change as cause of US forest fires and hurricanes, Biden laptop being unverified or Russian-sourced disinformation).  No retractions were ever issued and in many cases big tech continues to enforce content restrictions based on these false narratives.

Big tech is carefully selecting which sources they use to fact check based on their own views and confirmation bias.  And the few parties actually fact-checking these fact-checkers are simply ignored.  In this way, big tech edits content and decides what gets published without being accused of editing or publishing and thus forfeiting their protected position as a platform under the legal limitations of the 230 clause.

I don't need protection.  I need information.  I can make my own decisions, and believe it or not, so can everyone else.  We've been doing it for thousands of years.  Every barrier you put in the way between an individual and the world they experience serves only to box them in from where they can go and what they can be; what they can sense and what they can know.  A marble rolling across a table strewn with pencils wont go very far, but will probably still fall off the edge.  You're not doing favours by adding any ""feature"" that discourages someone from exploring ideas, based on your own conclusions.  This only denies that person the growth of undertaking that thought journey themselves and arriving at their own conclusions.  And repeated warnings do discourage - that's the trick and the whole point.  You don't have to close down a road to prevent its use if you put down enough speed bumps.  This is tyranny, no matter how much they try to pass it off as benevolence.  Since at least the start of the 20th century, such ""tyranny as benevolence"" is the hallmark of every oppressive regime at its infancy: later comes the book burning, statue-topling, murder, misery, starvation, genocide.

Tens of millions of informed people think what YT does in regard to filtering, promoting, supressing, blocking and subjectively discrediting non-violent, non-extremist ideas is unhealthy to individuals and to society.  Many like myself believe it is reprehensibly evil.  I think at the very least ideas within the Overton window, as decided by the metacontent of overall public discourse and not by some academic or media think tank, should be treated with absolute neutrality, while anything outside it should be examined and acted upon only with serious accountability and responsive recourse.  Media and big tech, like politicians, should be in the business of detecting, not defining, where the overton window lies.  Any society where these entities do more of the latter can no longer declare itself a free society and has moved away from democracy.

I choose software that breaks these kinds of shackles wherever possible.  I'll stop using newpipe if such a feature, as requested by this thread, were implemented mandatorily, and would immediate seek alternatives if they were optionally implemented by default.  I would only support their opt-in implementation for the purpose of allowing users to test and compare the experience and for those few who don't trust in their own ability to discern between fact, fiction, deception, and dillusion (e.g. a schizophrenic).",1,0,prediction_comments_newpipe.csv

21890,"Wikipedia is not a reliable source of information.  Neither is WHO for that matter - without careful scrutiny - as they are politically compromised despite many good and respectable people working within.  Even so, big tech chooses to cite legitimate info put out by WHO and declare them a definitive authority when it agrees with their political priors, only to later willfully ignore info from the same source when it doesn't agree by silencing voices, stories and claims strongly supported by WHO, UN, and leading economists, researchers, scientists, educators, thought leaders, industry experts, etc.  Whatever variey of fact checking and validation YT uses, it is not neutral and has a demonstrably negative value in the overall dissemination of information which is arguably not balanced by its positive impact.


ADepic, you know nothing about me, my political inclinations, or my knowledge or lack thereof, or methods and standards by which I educate myself.  In my opinion, your ad hominem attacks are inappropriate to this forum.

By your rapidfire derogatory reactions, evidently replying before even reading my entire comment, you're clearly behaving as one of those really angry twitter types who likes to shut down anyone who disagrees with you and call others to do the same.  Your first recourse was to ridicule and taunt and suggest others do the same.  I've seen no evidence you have any impulse to have an honest and civilized discussion.  You don't care what others think because you already KNOW, is seems.  You make it seem there's nothing someone the likes of me could possibly have to say that's of any value to you.  Why listen to anyone when they're all just stupid people who don't think what you think, which is the only correct way to think?

I wish I could admire your fervor and passion, or applaud you for taking an individual position and sticking to it.  But everything you said is so cookie-cutter and typical of our brainwashed youth who've lost the ability to think critically and the tolerance to have a conversation with someone who disagrees with them.  Everything is binary, and anything that doesn't fall in your lane must be labelled conspiracy theory.  He world is much more nuancdd than that.

*sigh*  I imagine you can't look in the mirror and see the tragedy of your outlook and behaviour right now.  But I hope it's just immaturity and that one day you will see the rabid intollerance and narcissism in your treatment of others as you've exemplified here, and realize that you do indeed have have a lot to learn by being less judgemental and impulsively combative.  Even better would be if you're just having a really bad day, and this doesn't reflect who you really are.

Intelligent people know they exercise their intellect by listening, not speaking.  And good scientists know that it's not a sin to not know something, only to think you do when you clearly don't.  Also, ""It's better to have questions you can't answer than to have answers you can't question.""

With that, I feel I've adequately stated my position on the issue and responded to the ad hominem attacks directed at me.  I'm feel this discussion and all others should continue with an interest of improving the software and encourage all points of view be considered with due respect, with a focus on the user experience rather than morality or top-down regulation, in agreement with what TheGinGear suggested.

Exactly I was thinking the same, to add other crypto, not just for the high fees but to avoid the hassle of convert to another crypto, adding the main ones not the shitty cryptos 😄 This should go in other issue, I will close this one.

25756,"@cherryland if you do not like these features, please feel free to fork the application and/or use an older version.

This application is built by a team of voluntary software developers. We do not want to order them to work on certain things, that is not how free software projects work. Every contribution is reviewed by our volunteers and merged if it fits the project's general goals and meets our quality standards. There is actual project management, but it's not comparable to a company's, so your claim there was none is just wrong.

By the way, the app runs perfectly on many-years-old devices, the performance argument doesn't hold at all IMO.

Feature creep is the entirely wrong term here. We don't have a project plan into which features could creep. We're not a company and don't charge any money for our ""product"", nor do we pay our developers.

By the way, your rude tone is not appreciated. You could've worded this in a more friendly way as well.

>useless features

if the feature is useless for you it doesn't mean it's uselss for everyone else

It would be nice to have a list of features that you don't like or they seems redundant to you. From that people could discuss it.

>It results in software bloat and over-complication

Software that people are usually call ""bloat"" is usually bad designed, not reliable and lagging as hell. Good example of complex software with A LOT of features is ffmpeg, but still, I can't call it ""bloat"" becuase it just doing the job perfectly well and incredibly fast.

>NewPipe is making the same mistake as Microsoft did 20 years ago: Adding features by user request.

There is little difference between reason of adding features. In case of newpipe, there is no ""business"" between developer and user's request. It's free software.

>Microsoft Excel 1997 for example was so filled with ""features"", it became unusable.

While I'm not a microsoft fan (i am microsoft hater actually), I can argue with the point that Excel 1997 just solves most peoples requests and that's all.

>Feature creep (also know as Featuritis, Creeping featurism or the spoonerism) kills good experiences.

Nope. Performance issues, page decoding issues, video stuttering issues - all these kills good experiences. Newpipe still have some issues that forces me to use stupid web browser because newpipe is unable to play some videos properly.

In case of ""feature creep"" - well designed interface could solve decreasing user expeirence after adding new features.

>I appreciate NewPipe's efforts, but the time has come to add some project management.

I appreciate for everyone's efforts, especially people who add more critique, because during tight critique best ideas will born. The time has come to add some list of features that looks redundant for you and explanation why you don't like them.

That's just Android's API. I don't see how Kotlin would help with that. We're not actively converting the code to Kotlin, but we accept new code written in Kotlin in NewPipe. We're going to fully move to view binding (or data binding when view binding isn't enough for that fragment) though, see #3697. Also, NewPipe's code is currently just pretty crappy.

Some more details: When you use docker-compose for deployments, every deployment gets its own *user-defined network*. These networks nowadays get their own DNS servers. Turned out they don't support reverse DNS lookups! What the heck!

Took me two hours to debug, I even added the app to some Sentry instance to get more context data.

It just won't work, and I am beyond frustrated.

I already spent hours entering everything by hand once before, just to have to wind up doing it all over again.

That's not going to happen.

Features that don't work are not features at all, and should not be included in the app.

It's one thing to need to enter everything by hand, but quite another to be teased with a so called simple method 'feature' that does not function at all.

This app is wonderful, and I recommend it to all my friends.

But the addition of 'features' that don't function will make an idiot of me for having my friends try it.

It would be better if the whole subscription thing did not exist at all, especially since we must keep the actual YouTube app so that we can add comments of our own to the content.

Sorry for the rant, but I have already wasted yet another hour attempting to import my subscriptions, and almost (not quite) feel like it would be better to put up with the ads on YouTube.

At least that's a bit less frustrating.

Was the chosen solution.

But damn, was it a buggy road. I finally figured out a way to do that work: _do not_ mess with visibility of the view being added to the window manager. Maybe it was messing with the view being measured? Problem with using `MATCH_PARENT`? Well, it all sorted it out at the end...

Yet, there's still a major bug left: the popup don't have the right position if it was positioned in the keyboard area when it appears. Maybe the solution will be something similar to how the the close overlay works, a `MATCH_PARENT` view. We can use it to detect its size changing (the draggable area) and update its boundaries accordingly. Didn't mess with it yet, something for another time/PR...

I have removed the shaking.

I made all this work just because i wanted this feature. If you don't want it you can avoid using it. That's why i made it optional and created the setting for this feature. I really hate to enable autorotation. I need landscape only in video/photo apps. And that feature for me and for other people with such problem is musthave. Let's think about users.
What's a problem with optional setting?

> When rotating NewPipe from portrait to landscape mode via rotate button, than click the fullscreen button NewPipe keeps beeing in landscape even if you leave the VideoDetail fragment.

That behaviour is needed because when user is watching a video he wants to look at description for links or something without changing phone orientation. Without that he will need to change phone orientation, then look at description then rotate the phone back. Awful usability. I love good usability
Another thing you didn't count is that not all videos use a landscape orientation. Some of them use portrait. It means without fullscreen button people can't see ""portrait"" video in fullscreen mode. Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhaVF9AMNag

>When In portrait already: Start video in fragment
>When in landscape already: Start video in fullscreen

This is what we have now.

>Video automatically starts playing when Video item is selected while device is in landscape.

It happens only if autoplay enabled. I think it is what autoplay setting should do, shouldn't it? :)
Upd: Oops, autoplay setting is for another porpose. I can create one more autoplay setting that will be disabled by default. But you should know that for now current autoplay setting is not used because I don't track is video was opened from external app or not. So I think we need this option renamed to ""Autoplay all videos"" and disabled by default. What do you think?

>Actuall background player should be started.

Didn't understand you. BackgroundPlayer is a service. Mainvideoplayer is a service. When app goes to background video is disabled and only audio plays. This behaviour is identical to what BackgroundPlayer do. What are you asking for?  If i will switch to backgroundPlayer then there will be an audio lag (between transition for loading audio) and user will can't switch to video next time he opens an app. And there will be two services running. And mainvideoplayer will need to setup binding with backgroundplayer. It will make things work bad. If you know how to make it good feel free to make commits.

38674,"Any free software license grants anyone a perpetual(!) usage right, including modifications, redistribution with/without modifications etc. That's the spirit of free software. Without picking one of those ""we publish the source, but don't allow modifications and also don't want you to redistribute it"" licenses, it's impossible (and undesirable) to prevent people from making use of the source code. You can't do anything about it legally. And most measures you guys suggested are totally against the spirit of free software in a similar way the rebranding self-entitled ""app developers"" are.

Developing in secret doesn't solve any of these issues, especially when releasing the source code after publishing the app first.
Not being a fan of Google Play etc., I'm always critic to publishing software, and especially free software, on such platforms (you never know in what ways they modify the binaries). 
Another problem is Android, as being mostly proprietary, is a difficult platform for free software anyway. You're always subject of misuse, and even if the illegal copies are just online for a few days or weeks, they might generate enough revenue for the publisher, hence rendering any takedown pretty useless.

Here's a few options I thought about:

  - We could add a constraint to the license forbidding any publishing on Google Play (and those Asian and Arabic  app stores) without consent of Team NewPipe's administrative board. This would be a measure that you could enforce legally, especially on Google Play (because suing someone in Arab countries is difficult, extremely expensive, and these states might not even acknowledge local copyright laws). However, that also means we'd have a proprietary custom license, which leads to a lot of issues with other systems such as F-Droid, and eliminates our status as free software project. It might even prevent further inclusion there.
 
  - You could also add a constraint that adding any kind of advertising would be a violation of the license. But this has the same implications as the above suggestion.

  - Protect the term NewPipe as a trademark (expensive and difficult). Then you also have the power of trademark protection, and could enforce legal actions if the rebranded apps work and look like the original, etc.

People are free to sell copies of NewPipe, yes, even after rebranding (but they must always show who's written the original source code). The ""danger"" you mentioned is probably in us performing the entire development, while someone else takes all the credit. Well, I wouldn't be happy with that either, but before we'd sell NewPipe ourselves or adding proprietary clauses to the licenses, I'd rather try to accept and tolerate that. If you're working on free software only because it'd look good in your CV, what's the point of developing free software then, right? Just make it proprietary and you're good to go. And I'm pretty sure that's not the way @theScrabi would want to put things.

Another option to keep as many pieces as free software while preventing illegal forks etc. would be to keep core components such as the extractor in separate projects, while making only the frontend code proprietary in the ways @karyogamy suggested.

But please rethink your ideas. They're strongly opposed to the idea of ***free(!)*** software and even open source (in the way that you publish source code with a proprietary license). I personally think you should stop worrying about code being stolen or rebranded so much. It's sad, but you can't really do much about it, and should invest your time in more useful tasks. Instead, try to gain more publicity, tell people about the issues we experience as a popular free software app, and make sure people add negative votes to bad copies. That'll increase the visibility of NewPipe as the original project, and as soon as people start acknowledging NewPipe as a thing, they'll recognize the illegal rebrandings, and their business will go down. (They'll probably find another target anyway, but well...)

P.S.: Maybe (and that's a *big* maybe) we can even sue some of the rebranding assholes (offensive language, but that's just the sad truth...) for abusing our error reporting service by setting up some Terms of Service document which we also publish in this repository. But I'm pretty certain the costs (talking about time _and_ money here) outweigh the benefits by far, as with any other legal action.

A solution that I'm thinking is:

We get the device country code (the language/country code, e.g. `en`, `pt`, `de`) and put that in every request, that way, this mixing would not occur and both the interface and content would be in ""sync"".

Yeah, regex is a dirty way of doing this. I also thought about using the get_video_content thing, but I didn't do this because it would require a lot of refactoring, since the config page misses the `args` attribute with the decryption JavaScript code. I tried to convert the map to a JSONObject, but when I do, the `loadDecryptionMethod` fails. However, I'm not sure whether the ugly JSON regex wouldn't fail at that method. It contains the `args` key as far as I can see.

I'll look at how youtube-dl handles this. It seems to fetch the args key from the embed page with regex. See: https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/blob/master/youtube_dl/extractor/youtube.py#L1363

If I remember correctly from looking at the source, the issue is hard to fix because there is a fundamental design decision at the heart of the issue based on a bad assumption about the spec, probably by reading too much into the example without properly reading the spec itself (the type of the 'content' field is quite explicitly a Map[""String"", Media Type Object]).

API endpoints are not RPCs and hence are not uniquely valued mathematical functions!

6098,"> Ah, thank you for explaining that. How about we switch python-experimental to definition #2?

The problem is I wouldn't be surprised if a bunch of OAS authors use definition 1. Do you think most authors care to write the mouthful schema for arbitrary JSON documents:

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Blob:
      nullable: true      # cannot use type: 'null' in OAS 3.0
      oneOf:
        - type: object
        - type: array
        - type: boolean
        - type: string
        - type: number
```

One practical issue I see is that many validators are lenient, the OAS spec lacks examples, so it's easy to assume that ""type: object"" equates arbitrary JSON document.

In that case, the python-experimental SDK would not work for them. Maybe it could be a build-time configuration option, as I proposed? 

Also, it's awful if the generated methods end up being something like GetOneOfObjectOrArrayOrBooleanOrStringOrNumber(). Then the author swaps elements in the array, and the generated code becomes GetOneOfArrayOrObjectOrBooleanOrStringOrNumber. Ouch.

In that case in golang it would be nice to have just **GetBlob() interface{}**. But that's a special case. On the other hand the schema could also use referenced, structured schemas.

7402,"I have the problem that I have to work with a client where I cannot set or change the jackson parser. In order for the generated code to work I have to assure that it just works without any custom jackson parser. My final goal would be that every configuration is made in the model such that the model is independend from the used parser. That could be done via just removing the configurations from the mapper and adding it to the models on a major release or to add flags.
As far as I see it does not seem to be popular to make the generator usable via adding flags (the only configuration option) which would mean or lead to that the user is compelled to writing his/her own generator / adapt existing generators which would also lead to maintenance hell. Is the value more worth than the cost to use the generator, have your own fork, distribute it around your company and have to maintain it to keep it up to date?
In my opinion the greatest value of a generator is to be configurable. No one can assume that a generator is easy to configure if (and only if) you want to configure everything. I see no possible way to not add parameters but at the same time wanting to keep the generator usable. A generator is a complex problem hence the addition of parameters makes it more complex but at the same time more usable.

I would like to rethink this whole pull request since I implemented it with the thought of minimal inversive changes:
- What are the runtime costs of moving the configuration out of the mapper to annotations on each model? One possibility could be a longer runtime when parsing or writing json since jackson needs to use more reflections in total.
- Is it of any interest for a generated-mapper-user if the generated code uses configuration or annotation? Is there any pro/con to do it in a specific way?
- what would be the best long term solution?

Some Ideas how this feature can be implemented general:
- like mentioned above configuring where the configuration should be
  - via one flag for all features
  - via one flag per feature / config option
- just use both, configuration and annotation, all the time
- remove all the configuration from the mapper into the model
- Use mapper as default, but add a flag which removes the mapper and moves the configuration to annotations.
- Do nothing and force some users to use a fork to be able to monkey patch this issue and create tickets and pull requests to try to solve this problem once and for all.

15888,">  I already noticed it with sdk models(components), you start with cute classes like from the book and then spec says ""Model can be primitive type, consider your User class as a string or Boolean"" and the code of your model turns into crap immediately.

:laughing: ",1,1,prediction_comments_openapigenerator.csv
16628,"Digging in a bit, it seems like the steps causing this are:

0. you get some data for twothings, containing some properties that ""belong"" to thingone, and other properties that ""belong"" to thingtwo
1. the composite model validates the received data in the context of thingone.  At this time, the properties that ""belong"" to thingtwo are treated as additionalProperties - unknown filthy vagrants subject to whatever cleanup and coercion is on offer.  (Because the addtionalProperties type is `true`, which allows any kind of data in an additionalProperty, so the validator tries to be helpful and upconvert whenever possible.)
2. the result is that the string properties that ""belong"" to thingone are kept as strings, while the string properties that ""belong"" to thingtwo are upconverted if they match a date format or etc.
3. the composite model then validates the received data in the context of thingtwo.  This time, it's the properties that ""belong"" to thingone that get upconverted.
4. the whole process returns the data as validated by the last subschema to process the data.  So you can fiddle with which half of the string properties get upconverted by changing the names of the subschemas.  (Presumaby this changes the order in which they are fetched from whatever python dict they are stored, or something.)

I can keep the upconversion from happening by specifying additionalPropertiesType in each subschema, like this:
```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    thingone:
      additionalProperties:
        type: string
      type: object
      properties:
        propone:
          type: string

    thingtwo:
      additionalProperties:
        type: string
      type: object
      properties:
        proptwo:
          type: string

    boththings:
      allOf:
        - $ref: ""#/components/schemas/thingone""
        - $ref: ""#/components/schemas/thingtwo""
```

That works for this toy problem ...  but in my real spec, I want to mix thingone and thingtwo with other schemas that contain dates and booleans and all kinds of stuff.  So I don't want to limit what types those other things can be.

I think my options, if this turns out to be a non-bug, are:
1. Isolate sub-schemas.  I can wrap each subschema in its own key within the parent, like this:
```yaml
    boththings:
      type: object
        properties:
          thingone:
            $ref: ""#/components/schemas/thingone""
          thingtwo:
            $ref: ""#/components/schemas/thingtwo""
```
I already have a lot of code that assumes `boththings.propone` rather than `boththings.thingone.propone`, so I'd like to avoid this if possible.

2. Manual mix-ins.  I can manually put propone and proptwo inside of boththings.  This is will make my api spec ugly, but it would be *a lot* less work than option 1
3. Teach the python code generator to let the sub-schema that ""owns"" the property to specify its type.  In my ignorance, this sounds like the best answer...?  Though I may have to go with option 2 just for expediency for now.",1,1,prediction_comments_openapigenerator.csv

- at first it seemed like a good idea to check for existence of an attribute, before accessing it (the error mentioned in this issue report indicates that the generated code tries to access the `_composed_schemas` attribute, while it doesn't exist
- however, when digging a bit deeper, the `_composed_schemas` attribute _should_ exist for any model that is not a primitive type, or a SimpleModel. So, it could very well be that no checks should be implemented, but rather the control logic in model_utils.py should be improved.

Documentation says :

When doing a **sbt clean**, the output directory of openapi is deleted, meaning my .openapi-generator-ignore would also be deleted.
In addition of that, adding a target / generated / build directory in VCS would be a bad practice, and I don't want my whole team to have to recreate this file when cloning the project.

If I can add this file somewhere else, or reference it from another directory, then yes, it could work.

BUT... in the same time I still think i shouldn't have to specify by myself files names.
To make my point clearer : you have an option to prevent models creation, even if people could add every model file in the openapi-generator-ignore file.

An example of the benefit's I can see to this change(whether it be nullable or changing the behavior of required) is on a view model, I've defined something such as:

    name: string;
    jobTitle: string;

It's perfectly acceptable for these fields to be null, however they will **never** be undefined. The problem I have is that I map from an api model, to this view model for rendering, and the api model generates as:

    name?: string;
    jobTitle?: string;

Which then forces me to do:

    const response: PersonViewModel = {
        name: apiResponse.name || null,
        jobTitle: apiResponse.jobTitle || null

Otherwise the linter throws a bitch fit because `string | undefined` cannot be assigned to `string`.

The ? from the type disappears if I mark the fields as [Required] in my api, but this then breaks the contract because the api will reject if the properties are null, but I actually expect them on certain conditions to be null, they're only [Required] so that typescript-inversify doesn't generate them as ` | undefined`",1,1,prediction_comments_openapigenerator.csv

Just because there are no examples doesn't mean there's no usecase. The Scala example proves there is, IMO.

So what are you talking about? You start by complaining about sourceforge, then Gitter is the problem because it requires a Github account, which it doesn't, but it's not an anonymity issue (what's the issue then?). You apparently were talking about Stackoverflow traffic: apparently it's not right to use SO as a support channel (why?). You go on to argue that we should shepherd users to Github and Gitter from SO, possibly using a demonic automated tool that scrapes reports, for us to cleanup. And now, you were not talking about SO all along? Could you be a bit easier to follow? I feel like you're only saying what you're *not* talking about

> My point is that if it's perceived as an issue, PMD interlocutors must

OPs from where, if not SO?

And this is already what's being done. There are some we miss, but again: we can't be everywhere, and OPs have a responsibility too in where and how they report issues. 

We can improve the report rate by documenting clearly what we expect. This is what I've been arguing for since my first message, it's a step towards a solution. Could you explain what more we can reasonably do? What are your requirements to close this discussion exactly?

> That ought to be good enough for the OP. It might not be good enough for
PMD especially if the bug or issue is genuine and has not been reported
before (in any other form). Relying on the OP is not the optimal
solution.

PRESTO_ENABLE_PARQUET should be removed completely with this change. Where else do you see this?
The current Velox setup for Parquet is that we create empty parquet libraries (for reader, writer) when VELOX_ENABLE_PARQUET is disabled and we include Parquet components (reader, writer) in the libraries when enabled.

If we want to make parquet lib link to an executable, then we will have to add these `if(PRESTO_ENABLE_PARQUET)` blocks to each executable which is ugly and I wanted to avoid with the empty library approach.

39816,"@martint Let me elaborate a bit more on the topic. To ensure that we are on the same page.

I see few approaches here:

**(1)**
- **SQL layer**: single type `VARCHAR(x)`
- **Codebase layer**: single implementation `VarcharType`

This is shown as a strawman.
We do not want this approach as we do not want to expose ugly `VARCHAR(MAX_INT)` to 
users. And also this would break backward compatibility.

**(2)**
- **SQL layer**: two types `VARCHAR` and `VARCHAR(x)`
- **Codebase layer**: single implementation `VarcharType`

Unparameterised `VARCHAR` SQL type signature is mapped internally to `VARCHAR(MAX_INT)`. And represented as `VarcharType.createVarcharType(MAX_INT)`.
We add a few hacks to ensure that user always see `VARCHAR(MAX_INT)` as just `VARCHAR`.
Internally we treat type signatures `VARCHAR` and `VARCHAR(MAX_INT)` as equal.

Pros/Cons
(+) Simpler implementation. (one java type, one set of operators/functions)
(-) Not really unbounded. But 2GB should be enough for everybody ;).
(-) Need for hacks around signature parsing/stringifying

**(3)**
- **SQL layer**: two types `VARCHAR` and `VARCHAR(x)`
- **Codebase layer**: two implementations `VarcharType` and `UnboundedVarcharType`

We add separate java type for `VARCHAR` without parameters.
Approach seems cleaner but requires a lot of coding. Implementation can be tricky, as we now would have two different types which share same base ""VARCHAR"". This would possibly imply some (a lot of?) problems.

With this approach we need to implement all the methods/operators defined for `VARCHAR(x)` to operate on `VARCHAR`.
We cannot be depend on coercion as `VARCHAR` would not be coercible to any `VARCHAR(x)`.

Pros/Cons
(+) Cleaner approach (1-1 mapping between SQL types and java types)
(+) Unbounded
(-) More code to maintain
(-) Possible hacks around the codebase due to two types sharing base
(-) Extra work

So far we were approaching **(2)** and I still believe this is way to go. @Martint do you agree? We need to have common understanding here. So there is not too much throwaway work done.

44482,"I see the problem you mention. I don't see any easy way around it. 
That doesn't make the motivation for the change to be less important ;) Lets hope there's a way to get there.

In the long run I think it would be desirable to be able to allow different subprojects to allow connect to Presto. Breaking this up into separated modules with defined and separated responsibilities would be a way to implement that as you mention. 

For now, to unblock our work I think we should copy-paste the necessary code to a separate project and manually keep track of the changes made to this code on both sides (yuck!). 

In the background I propose we start fixing the problem more systematically. 
**The problem** is we have a set of model classes on the wire and some logic to manipulate them on each end. 

**One option** is to copy-paste it to every project that needs to talk to Presto, I would strongly opt we throw this out the window. 
**Second option** would be to break the Presto project into subprojects, have a presto-cli-base that is java 6 compatible and other projects (including Presto, verifier, jdbc, ...) depend on it, that should allow to overcome the circular dependencies. This requires a lot of effort and rearranges things a lot. Maybe too much and not worth the effort. Maybe on the other hand there are other reasons to do it, eg. some of the Presto sub-modules today should be external tools depending on Presto, not inside Presto, I don't know, haven't analyzed it all, just speculating that there may be more motivation for such a separation. The net result could be a cleanly separated set of projects. Then again it may complicate the daily development too much if there is a lot of work spanning all potential sub-projects. 
**Third option** we could consider is to describe the protocol in a way that allows the clients the automatically generate the necessary model. Depending on the implementation choice the Presto listener side keeps it's hand-coded version or wraps the generated classes with some more custom validation logic, which is today present there. Leveraging current implementation choice (JAX RS) we could express the protocol via a WADL file, problem we would have is that Presto today send meta information in headers and handle them by hand, WADL supports header information but we'd need to change the way we handle it. Another approach would be to reimplement the meta-information to embed it in the JSON. Last (not least) way to do would be to start using something like GRPC, or sth else instead of JAX RS.

Absolutely. The zip file contains two 7Z files; the Mac one contains over 300mb of error output, the Windows one 100 times less, as I primarily use my Windows machines for .NET programming.

> > It would be best if you could send me some sketch which crashes the editor (I would of course keep it confidential). If you want to contact me directly my email is on my profile.

I can send you things, but the behavior is fairly agnostic toward any particular sketch, and as thus I would be flat out guessing as to an appropriate file to send.

I will look through my .err files, to see if it logs the sketch which caused the error [one would think such would be the case]. If the sketch name is logged, I will mine the files for the most frequent offender, and send it.

Please keep in mind that I use Processing to rapidly prototype algorithms for my art, so the code isn't pretty and I would personally fire any developer who checked in anything even remotely this ugly. But then again, the targets of my code analysis consider me a bit of a hardass and dread being brought in front of me in meetings....so who knows, maybe it isn't so bad.

@StanLepunK

I get the gift of the error prompt window you attached at least a few times per week as well. Isn't that failure mode just wonderful?

Generally with any of the exceptions mentioned in this thread, the processing instance gets hosed and must be completely nuked before it takes down the entire machine...which it will do.

The ones brought on by trans-window copy/paste are the most annoying, because they prevent even saving of your current work.

As I said, all of this adds up to my pending abandonment of Editor for IntelliJ once I figure out how to build the IntelliJ equivalent of VSIX templates, but that isn't any reason for me to keep these errors to myself, given that it will result in the net improvement of the package for everyone. 

Maybe one day my beloved Rectangular Selections will come back. ;) I would issue a monetary bounty for that feature if I thought it would do any good, and I am not kidding just in case someone is interested...

1273,"Coming on close to 3 years of no support for pre-multiplied alpha in Processing 3. I thought I'd post and be a squeaky wheel! 

For those who arrive here still having this issue, there's a work around, kind of. You add a ""blendMode(REPLACE)"" before drawing shapes within a PGraphics element. If you wish to draw an image within PGraphics, you must revert to blendMode(BLEND). This creates a tinted halo in the lower alpha pixels of the image, however. It's subtle, but the more layering of images there are and interactions with those layers, the more obvious, ugly, and problematic it becomes. It might not bother many of the amateurs that Processing attracts, but for professionals, it remains a no go to upgrade to Processing 3 because of this one issue. I'll continue to work with Processing 2 until there is support for proper blending.  

Much respect to the team, by the way. Appreciate you endlessly. And Jakub, you turning me onto InteliJ 2.5 years ago changed my life! Processing 2 is amazing. I'm just sore after checking on this issue, that I can't go and upgrade already and reap the benefits of 3. Best Regards

",1,1,prediction_comments_processing.csv
1305,"I neglected to provide the historical context of all this: 

Blocking I/O has been a _feature_ of Processing since the outset. When we first created Processing, Java users had to create a `MediaTracker` object that would asynchronously load images, monitoring them for final availability. It was a f*king nightmare, because for most people who are learning to code, it's baffling that you can't simply load an image and start working with its pixel content. For people who already knew how to code, they got little out of re-implementing all the necessary layers to handle image loading and pixel grabbing.

Similarly for other types of data, it was necessary to read from an `InputStream` in chunks just to get data from it. For our audience, this is total nonsense: from the learning side, it was an extremely complex mess for something as simple as loading an image; but even from the code and practice side, for the overwhelming majority of projects built with Processing, it's not actually possible to _use_ the sketch until its image (or other) data is loaded, so we made the decision to pursue synchronous methods. 

As with all API decisions, this was done with full awareness (and intent) that users who want to use—and understand—asynchronous I/O are free to use the native Java versions of similar functions: Processing offered a simpler alternative (that would work for most people) that worked in all contexts (applets, applications, run from the PDE, double-clickable JAR file), while not preventing advanced users from doing their own thing.

Fast forward several years, and the calculus has changed a bit. First, with Processing becoming more detached from Java (as we move to support Python, JavaScript, etc), the ""just use the Java methods"" approach is less viable. Second, many of our users nowadays have experience with Javascript or other web development, so they're often familiar with concepts like `XMLHttpRequest`. Third, at the start of a program (i.e. inside `setup()`), you usually want things to load synchronously. But during execution (i.e. inside `draw()` and friends), you likely want asynchronous methods. Finally, the bottom line is that asynchronous methods are helpful. We've had the under-utilized `requestImage()` method in the API for a long time, but it'd be nice to have a way to do this with other types of data. And part of the reason for Processing in the first place is to avoid the ""write a dozen lines of code to do one very basic thing"" that plagues Java and many other APIs that are designed for too general an audience.

And that, my friends, is the rest of the story.
",1,1,prediction_comments_processing.csv
1446,"For god's sake, different sketches using a common library? That's the exact opposite of what it's been talked about here: a sketch that would almost run seamlessly on different modes if it wasn't for a little snippet of code that needs to be different on different modes. 

At the very least for Java and JavaScript modes.

There are at least 3 reasons why one needs to be able to switch forth and back constantly between Java and JabaScript modes WHILE DEVELOPING a sketch. At most 2 of them will (optimistically) disappear in the (far) future, but the third will always remain:
1. Debugging in Processing.js is like hell. The debug information in error messages in Processing.js is extremely insufficient. It is plainly impossible to DEVELOP in Processing.js (a serious project), unless you are a supernatural genius that develops an entire project without ever making a mistake. So if your target is js, the only viable way of working is to switch to Java at least from time to time when something fails and you have no clue. That is a Processing.js issue which has to be fixed in Processing.js (but will probably take ages because it is not easy).
2. Support for applets has been dropped, so the only way to publish a Processing sketch on the web is to switch it to JS mode. Many were written in standard (now Java) mode. There are 3rd party tools that allow to export applets, which addresses this case, and also this case will become less and less relevant while developers start using the JS mode from the beginning if the target is web, and Java if the target is a standalone application.
3. when being able to export the sketch in both ways is just a requirement in itself. Which includes, among other cases, TEACHING. Isn't Processing supposed to be especially suitable for teaching programming? When you are teaching, you don't know what the example code you provide will be used for, so you need to create examples that can be run in both modes so that a student can take them as a starting point both for developing a project in Java and for developing a web project.

Maybe, just maybe, it would be a good idea to simply strip the bundled Java stuff, which expands – even in its incomplete and broken form – to 82 MB on disk, from the tarball, which would then have less than 51 MB of download size and installs circa 76 MB on disk.

Or you could provide such a stripped tarball for the brave souls like myself, who also are a bit paranoid about package bloat.

BTW, Processing 3.3.3 compares even less favorably: It installs a total of 272 MB on disk, of which 197 MB are `java/`.

Other two are fixed, but I find Undo still terribly broken when more tabs are involved.

When Undo modifies more tabs, the code in Editor is updated, but they are not marked as modified (orange strip), and when I save without visiting the tabs, changes made by undo are not saved (something to do with SketchCode having both `Document` and `String program`). This is quite dangerous and confusing as hell.

I was also fighting with this with Rename and I temporarily fixed it in some places (JavaBuild, PreprocessingService) by re-reading documents from all tabs instead of using SketchCode's `program`.

Also when Undo affects more tabs, you can undo only from one of them, others don't have any Undo available.

I think Undo needs to be fixed before 3.1. The situation with rewriting text from code is already quite convoluted and maybe it would be better to clean it up instead of adding more complexity by merging this. If you want I can look at it tomorrow.

@alignedleft @benfry you can read this for a better understanding of what i did and suggest if more has to be done.
The problem as far as i could understand was that the contribution that were being downloaded were getting added to the list one by one and after each one is added the list was made again from the scratch, that's why the ""scrollbar was going haywire"" . 
Another problem was that the contribution were being added on different threads, it was working fine in modes and tools as their number is small but in libraries it was breaking as the no of libraries is around 130. I think some thread was executing later that was making the scroll visible to the user and this was looking very ugly.

**What i did -**  
- I made the contributionAdded function not to use threading.
- This made the addition to the list very slow and the time lag was irritating so i modified the code so that the list is only updated once all the contribution have been added. This reduced the time approximately equal to the threading time.
- I made the list invisible while the above is being done, because if the list is visible during this process the layout has to be made and it would be a time consuming task.

``` processing
{ PJOGL.RETINA = true; }

    ... do stuff;

void draw() {

    stroke(0, 50);

When using `P2D` as an argument to `size()`, I get the following result when plotting Lissajous curves on a retina display with `strokeWeight(1)` and `stroke(0, 50)`.

`P3D` and `OPENGL` render fine but `P2D` render has those ugly blobs/artifacts. Also, the `saveFrame(""####.png"")`  doesn't save the image in full retina resolution despite of declaring `hint(ENABLE_RETINA_PIXELS);` in the `setup()` method.

Some of the things I still don't understand because of my own inexperience were like what to do about normals, but also Quads vs. Tris, and perhaps the need for ""remeshing"" things, a feature prominent in 3d tools like Blender. Anar+ does this cool thing where it goes on with the show even if your mesh is broken or invalid. Java 3D is surprisingly exhaustive of a lot of core structures.

I do work with systems integration quite a bit, and I can say that it sucks but sometimes your new system winds up usually being all of the other systems now just all together, and again like expressed before, is now its own system which is yet another thing to deal with. It could be nice to try to think future proof ideas like to be able to pivot around the n-th dimensions of a hyperplane or hypersurface, or if LLVM and other such compilation/translation/vm type stuff is the future for Java, how does one make sure that the solution is as pure of logic as possible so as to not tie itself further to machine or even environment specifics. 

I also like how the newer work by @codeanticode where the vectors are stored in the GPU. It would be cool to treat the GPU as your vertex database storage and accelerated manipulation engine.

Right, this is happening because the tree is manually being collapsed and expanded! The collapsing and expanding of tree elements should not be performed by the code. The API exists so that one can attain non-default behaviour such as ""expand on single click"", etc.

It is easy to verify that the manual expand/collapse is the problem:
- For a closed node, double clicking opens it (default action), then the code closes it!
- For an open node (open it using the + or the arrow on the left of the node), double clicking closes it (default action), then the code opens it!

I have attached a patch which essentially removes the manual expand/collapse of a branch node.

Also, consider using mousePressed instead of mouseClicked. A click is a mouse press followed by a mouse release but without any mouse movement in between these events! The current java implementations might have relaxed this a bit by allowing some jitter, I'm not sure about it though.

Umm... maybe I am not understanding the docs correctly. Why is getClickCount() not relevant within mousePressed? It is used here in Sun's (Oracle's) own documentation, specifically mentioning double click events:

""If you are interested in detecting either double-click events or when a user clicks on a node, regardless of whether or not it was selected, we recommend you do the following: ...""

Thanks for taking care of this. I agree it's rotten code to draw a circle with; that was just a test case and increasing the number of steps in the circle made the issue more legible.

However, even a more rational 180 steps in the circle still shows the jagged artifacts unless the hint is applied — makes me think the hint should remain on by default per previous versions of Java. (See attachment for 180 step example. The artifacts in the unhinted version are more subtle, but still quite asymmetrical and aggravating.)

Some background...

Browser makers have been going backwards in their support for Java applets, so high-framerate work like Processing has become almost unusable in many cases. This is especially pronounced on 64-bit versions of browsers. With the 2.0 release, and Apple's most recent Java update, we'll have some of these issues fixed, but we're really, really getting screwed by the browser makers. Most of whom hate Java applets and are disinclined to fix things. You can also see the issues in non-Processing Java applets that use animations with a high framerate or a lot of interactivity. (Lower framerate, non-continuous animations, and others have less trouble.)

The submitted code is less efficient, by your admission, and will change the output of currently existing sketches that use the current noise() method. Those are two major problems.

The issue you've identified has not been flagged by another person in the 10 years that it has existed in the software. That doesn't mean it's not a problem, but it does say that fixing it is not worth 1) sketch outputs changing and 2) sketches that use noise() becoming slower. For someone who wants accurate noise(), they can use your code without it being in the core. 

You appear to have taken this personally enough that you've now written a nasty, passive aggressive reply to a total stranger. It's just not necessary to behave like that, and I hope next time you'll think better of it.

The intention was not to make you seem morons, I just work with doubles a lot on the desktop and couldn't figure out why a project that's based on JVMs didn't offer the same precision as java's native java.lang.Math.

Those four points as to why people shouldn't use the double on http://processing.org/reference/double.html would probably be a good idea.

wrt that darned >>8 alpha blending...

So when the alpha value == 255 we pretend that that's full unity (1.0), then divide it by 256 (>>8) in the equation, giving slightly less than full unity (~0.0996), leading to various errors throughout ALL the blending math.

OK, so we all know the right way to fix it, right?  Simply replace "">>8"" with ""/255"" wherever that sort of thing occurs.  (and similarly there are a few equations containing a "">>7"" that should really be ""*2/255"")  But that's a 3-divisions-per-pixel (or more) hit where you may still prefer performace to accuracy.

There IS a way to improve (tho not completely fix) that accuracy with one division per pixel.  Instead of fixing it at the end in the blend equation per channel, we tweak it up front in the alpha value extraction once:

as is:
  int f = (b & ALPHA_MASK) >>> 24;

fix is to ""stretch"" f on 0..255 into f on 0..256
so at least the ends of the range are correct when later >>8'd

modified long form for readability:
  int f = ((b & ALPHA_MASK) >>> 24) \* 256 / 255;

modified short form for performance:
  int f = ((b & ALPHA_MASK) >>> 16) / 255;

(or you could potentially just set up that int[256] remap in advance, then:
  int f = stretch255to256[(b & ALPHA_MASK) >>> 24];
)

now when the actual RGBA alpha is 255, it will remap to 256, so that when later >>8 math occurs, unity is preserved.  there will still be ""dead"" spots in the math across the whole range, (as the ""stretched histogram"" of f will have ""plateaus"" where single input values repeat twice), but the overall error will be less (and in fact, this fix alone would be enough to correct the specific 255-2=254 problem demonstrated above in blend_subtract()), and the unity of 255==256==1.0 is at least sorted out.

anyway, long-winded, hth

Right, it should not be creating its associated texture data until the (legitimate) image attempts to draw itself to the surface. (And yes, that has to be hidden from the user.) That's why things were set up to use ImageCache the way they were in the desktop OpenGL renderer—the whole point there is that you can't do GL commands whenever you want to, and instead have to run it from the renderer. It's ugly as hell but it's the only way to hide all this from users.

That said, I don't recall whether requestImage() works correctly with the OPENGL setting, but you get the idea.

At the moment, it looks like we won't be able to bring back OpenGL applets, except where the entire applet is signed. 

We won't be implementing an auto-signing solution because a mass proliferation of self-signed Processing applets seems like a really bad idea (one person makes malware with it and we're all screwed).

This is not the case if the class will be structured like this:

  a.add(1,2,3).add(4,5,6);

  println(a.x, a.y, a.z);

Comment from jnz, 2009-09-14 15:15

I don't understand.  The test case I posted doesn't make any drawing calls
from within the key handler.

I'm also not sure I follow your logic about always using loop().  I'm in a
situation where the sketch normally runs at 10fps when in ""play mode"".  But
when it is in ""stop mode"" there will be no action and so no need to update
the screen.  I can call noLoop() to stop the applet from sucking up CPU
time.  But then if the user clicks or presses a key I'll need one (and only
one) screen update to show the changes they've made.  Unless, of course,
they click on ""play"" in which case I'd call loop() again.

Right now this is dangerous because the draw() routine can be interrupted
without my knowledge to go handle a key/mouse event.  And when it comes
back the invariants that one would just assume to hold have been violated.

I don't really know enough about how Java handles these events to offer a
complete technical solution.  Are they being delivered on the same thread
as the one running draw() or a separate one?  If the former, how does the
drawing code decide when to go off and handle an event?  If the latter,
couldn't one simply add a big synchronize lock around all the user-code to
avoid any reentrancy problems?

- needs to take into account splitting triangles as necessary

BTW, if a connector cannot access methods from modules like `pulsar-client-original` directly, it would be a bad experience for Pulsar connector developers.",1,0,prediction_comments_pulsar.csv

22184,"Hi, @liudezhi2098 

I think we need to refactor this method to make it more clear. some suggestions :

- It is recommended to use ""ThenCompose"" to compose asynchronous methods and use the outermost ""exceptionally"" to handle exceptions. Because a lot of ``catch`` and ``exceptionally`` look like callback hell and hard to read.
- Checked the ""catch"" logic, it seems that there are places where ""catch"" is not needed.

E.g.

**Bad version:** 

```java
   CompletableFuture.completedFuture(null)
                .thenAccept(__ -> {
                    CompletableFuture.completedFuture(null)

                                CompletableFuture.completedFuture(null)
                                        .thenAccept(unused3 -> {

                                        }).exceptionally(ex -> {
                                            // handle exception
                                            return null;
                                        });
                            }).exceptionally(ex -> {
                                //handle exception
                                return null;
                            });
                }).exceptionally(ex -> {

```

     * @return
     */
    ConsumerBuilder<T> payloadConverterClass(Class<?> clazz);
```

It's simple but looks ugly. After discussing with @codelipenghui, I adopted the current way to load converter at runtime. But there's something different. @codelipenghui's original opinion was that no changes should be made for client configs like `ConsumerBuilder`. However, there're some flaws for this solution. Because reflection brings overhead when creating a consumer. Though the overhead might not be significant, we should still avoid it for the regular cases.

I've thought of another solution that all consumers share the same converter so that the class loader could only be called once. But it might become complicated if there're multiple entry formats. For example, assuming we've enabled KoP, AoP, MoP for the same broker and there're three different entry formats. With PIP 96, we can implement three converters like:

- org.apache.pulsar.client.converter.kop.KafkaPayloadConverter
- org.apache.pulsar.client.converter.aop.AmqpPayloadConverter
- org.apache.pulsar.client.converter.mop.MqttPayloadConverter

Then we can create three consumers using a common `PulsarClient`. It's also why I configured the converter package at consumer level instead of client level.",1,0,prediction_comments_pulsar.csv

40045,"Hey.

We ran into the same problem as you described above. The better solution would be to have a config somewhere where we can set what gets appended to the issuerURL.

I implemented a small ghetto fix for myself and build pulsar from source until this gets officially implemented.
If this is something you want to do, here is what you need to change:

To ""fix"" your problem you need to change the line 100 in the DefaultMetadataResolver.java
from this: `return new URL(issuerUrl, ""/.well-known/openid-configuration"");`
to this: `return new URL(issuerUrl.toString() + ""/.well-known/openid-configuration"");`

Now the URL gets appended correctly and it works as expected.

To also get the client(producer/consumer) to work you need to change the following since they also do not work with keycloak URLs:
1. In the file /pulsar-client-cpp/lib/auth/AuthOauth2.cc in line 187 comment out the line.
`issuerUrl_.append(""/oauth/token"");`

2. Now you need to specify the full token endpoint from keycloak as the issuer_url in your client.
example: `https://example.com/auth/realms/myrealm/protocol/openid-connect/token`

The reason you need to do that is that after the first token expires, it tries to get a new one with the settings from the /.well-known configuration and it appends /oauth/token again to the tokenURL which obviously doesnt work.

I know its kind of a bad fix for now but i am to inexperienced to add a complete feature myself. We just want it to work for now and we will not be using it for production anytime soon. Just want to test features and infrastructure stuff and for that it works fine.

Hope it helps!

Actually I think you had a wrong impression here. 

the processing guarantees are used for determining the subscription type that Pulsar uses for reading messages from a Pulsar topic and the error handling for Pulsar writing messages to a Pulsar topic.

So the actual processing guarantee for connectors is not just relied on Pulsar guarantee but also on the implementation of source and sink.

For source connectors, the processing guarantees is much clear. Because Pulsar ensures writing messages to a Pulsar topic to be respecting to processing guarantee. It is within Pulsar's control.

For sink connectors, the processing guarantees replies on the sink implementation. If the sink implementation doesn't handle retries in the idempotent way,  the sink will not respect to the processing guarantees.

52297,"Issues with the current Helm chart:

- some insane default values, e.g. 4 GB RAM for the Proxy component (and there are 3 replicas)
- a Helm redeploy which happens to restart the Broker (and possibly other) pods will render the cluster unusable
- a Helm uninstall followed by a Helm (re)install with persistent volume claims will reattach the volumes, but Pulsar won't be able to use them and won't initialize properly, rendering it unusable
- changing a `ConfigMap` value and redeploying does nothing, pulsar components will keep using the old values
- the values.yaml config for Brokers doesn't allow exposing the broker service on NodePorts for direct (high performance) access thru the `pulsar://` protocol
- the Brokers should probably be deployed using a `StatefulSet` (just like BookKeepers are), as the RAM allocation is usually prohibitive of running multiple Brokers on the same node
- we should explain what Proxy really does (as Pulsar doesn't)
  - the `http://` protocol will only redirect your client to a direct/pod/ClusterIP `pulsar://` address, which will never work (unless you use EKS thru a VPC bridge -or- you have hardcoded your Broker URLs into the Proxy)
  - only the 'pulsar://` endpoint provides reverse proxying to the Brokers (but it needs a TCP load balancer, so e.g. you can't use Traefik 1.x to load balance multiple Proxies)
  - if your Brokers don't use SSL encryption, so can't your Proxy, because the the protocol type is carried thru Proxy, so you'll end up having to use unencrypted access thru public internet
  - due to these:
    - you'll really want to use only a small, single Proxy in your cluster for some external testing
    - for production use you'll want to expose the Pulsar Brokers on `NodePort`s, but since the Brokers do redirection for requests on topics they don't serve, you need to either:
      - set the `advertisedAddress` variable on the Broker to externally lookup-able hostname (in the context of your pulsar client) (the current Helm chart doesn't offer to do this, because you need to set a different one for each Broker)
      - somehow make the `hostname` on the Broker pod return externally lookup-able hostname (in the context of your pulsar client)

62637,"@mgodave This change doesn't solve the problem that the ugly `Thread.sleep()` was introduced as a workaround for.

The problem is not the sync vs async ZK call (though sure, the async with response continuation is more efficient). 

The real problem is that in ZK there is no read-your-write consistency by default. That is also aggravated by the fact the we have a cache for configuration/metadata that is updated with ZK watches.

The particular instance of the problem typically manifest itself only in a test environment where there are multiple brokers and multiple ZK servers in the ensemble. 

It goes like this: 
 * Create a partitioned topics --> create a z-node with the partitions info
 * Try to use the partitioned topic immediately after
    1. The request to check the partitioned topic metadata can go to a different broker
    2. That broker is connected to a different ZK server
    3. That ZK server is few steps behind the ZK quorum
    4. The partitioned topic metadata is not there in ZK

The ""good"" solution would be to always do a ZK `sync()` before reading the partitioned topic metadata. That would ensure that we can actually read our previous write.

The problem with that is that we have to do a ZK write (implied by `sync()`) and that we can never cache the info in broker.

63615,"Aww...  I'm currently researching technologies for a new employer that has interest in Kafka and a significant existing data science investment in Python.  I'm strongly of an opinion that regulatory privacy compliance concerns will eventually require owning whatever streaming technology they deploy rather than delegating its operation to a 3rd party PaaS provider.

While exploring my options for resolving language impedance between an existing code and skills investment in Python and a JVM-first platform technology, I came across Apache Pulsar this afternoon.  Admittedly, I am just at the beginning of my investigation, but after recognizing that Pulsar is an actively maintained project that has decomposed the problem it addresses in a way that has enabled it to provide the language support not present in Kafka and noting that it has recently graduated from incubator status, the very next triage-style question I that led me to this very thread was, ""What about DC/OS support?  Will installation/maintenance obscurities make diving deeper a non-starter?""

64210,"When I stumbled upon Plusar I died twice. First I read the description and, coming from a Kafka / Kubernetes background, I thought man these guys really tick everything I could wish for. After that, I clicked the Docs page and when I discovered those nasty ZK boxes in the diagram the dream died as fast as it was emerging.

I can understand the argument of not repeating yourself and it may look like a good idea to have that complicated quorum stuff sorted out with a separate microservice (ZK). However, If you produce the situation that the state of multiple services are interconnected and can desynchronize, its an operational nightmare. At least in a containerised and managed environment like Kubernetes.

Kafka has (finally) accepted this reality and is moving away from an external solution to embed quorum ([KIP-500](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-500%3A+Replace+ZooKeeper+with+a+Self-Managed+Metadata+Quorum)). By having the Quorum State and Broker Data state in the same location, desynchronisation are no longer possible and operations are very much simplified.

So my two cents would be, to not make ZK replaceable by something other, but instead remove the need for an external solution altogether. ",1,0,prediction_comments_pulsar.csv

564,"I have modified `Chunk#asResTable_lib_entry` with following dirty code:

```java

      ResTable_lib_entry lib_entry = new ResTable_lib_entry(device_chunk_.myBuf(), device_chunk_.myOffset() + header_size());
      return lib_entry;
    }
```

And make sure `LoadedArsc#Load`'s foreach for `RES_TABLE_LIBRARY_TYPE` with correct increment step:
```java
entry_iter.myOffset() != entry_begin.myOffset() + dtohl(lib.count) * ResTable_lib_entry.SIZEOF
```

Also need to add try-catch for new iterator entry (Actually it needs a checking for `ByteBuffer`'s end position to ensure the new offset doesn't exceed allowed position):

```java
              try {
                entry_iter = new ResTable_lib_entry(entry_iter.myBuf(), entry_iter.myOffset() + ResTable_lib_entry.SIZEOF);

                break;

1132,"Still having problems with testing animations with Robolectric 4.1 Can't the hell find a way how to invoke end of an animation, skip them, or anything that would enable me to test the results of animation. Is there any way to do this with Robo 4.1 at all?

This is because every time a single task is run on any Looper, it bumps adjusts the system clock, informs all listeners (which are O(N), where N is the number of background HandlerThreads), and then all the corresponding threads are woken up and need to get context switched into to check if there are any pending tasks.

5674,"Yeah, so check the downloaded file (I know it sucks, I'd be happy if you want to make a change to suppress the noisy output)

There are two failures:-

1) At all API levels

android.content.res.AssetManagerTest > openFd_shouldProvideFileDescriptorForAsset FAILED
    java.io.FileNotFoundException: This file can not be opened as a file descriptor; it is probably compressed
        at org.robolectric.shadows.ShadowArscAssetManager9.ReturnParcelFileDescriptor(ShadowArscAssetManager9.java:406)
        ...

This is because we don't support reading compressed assets as a FileDescriptor in binary resources yet. @xian would know why that is, maybe it wasn't feasibly possible with the Java APIs... this code was transliterated from the framework C code.

But if this failure suggests that aapt2 is compressing assets where as before aapt v1 wasn't (I have no idea, just speculating) we should probably take a look at fixing that (looks like it can be disabled with aaptOptions.noCompress = 'txt')

https://google.github.io/android-gradle-dsl/current/com.android.build.gradle.internal.dsl.AaptOptions.html#com.android.build.gradle.internal.dsl.AaptOptions:noCompress(java.lang.String)

Some random Googling suggests that assets are being compressed in the root asset folder, but not custom subfolders, so could maybe move the asset its trying to load there as a work around?

See: https://discuss.gradle.org/t/android-aaptoptions-nocompress/22816

If this fixes it, please open an issue to track adding support for compressed files as FileDescriptors as well.

2) Only on API 28

android.content.res.ResourcesTest > getXml STANDARD_OUT
    [Robolectric] android.content.res.ResourcesTest.getXml: sdk=28; resources=binary

android.content.res.ResourcesTest > getXml FAILED
    android.content.res.Resources$NotFoundException: Resource ID #0x7f140006
        at android.content.res.ResourcesImpl.getValue(ResourcesImpl.java:216)
        at android.content.res.Resources.loadXmlResourceParser(Resources.java:2155)

which could be a bug in the binary resource support for API 28 (Note: I'm drawn to that conclusion because there a was a big re-write of the framework code and @xian had to basically do the same transliteration work all over again, but this test passes with the older transliterated code but not the new stuff, see ShadowArscAssetManager vs ShadowArscAssetMananger9)

https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_frameworks_base/blob/pie-release/core/java/android/content/res/ResourcesImpl.java#L216 - AssetMananger.getResourceValue() returns false for that id so ShadowArscAssetManager9.nativeGetResourceValue() is returning 0 - I suspect a bug

To get around this, you could also try adding 

android.enableAapt2=false

to the gradle.properties file.

14083,"@xian We tried running this code against 4.1.2 and, predictably, there are about 50 failures (roughly how many we had when we swapped in 4.3 originally). 

So we need a way to write code across Robolectric that is SDK-version-aware. We took a quick look at getting the SDK version switching working but we need to know the `emulateSdk` value in some random pieces of Robolectric. Do you have any ideas of where we could store (and manage) this value globally so we can write code that switches on SDK version?

Globals suck though... it would be nice if this value (or the whole Config instance) could be injected into every Shadow on construction. Possible? Other classes would need it as well but most of those are constructed in some way via the TestRunner, so injecting the Config down from there might work.

14619,"I finally managed to get debugging working for this project and the problematic code seems to be on Robolectric in **/src/main/java/org/robolectric/res/StyleData.java** at this function:

``` java
  @Override public Attribute getAttrValue(ResName resName) {
    resName.mustBe(""attr"");
    Attribute attribute = items.get(resName);

    // yuck. hack to work around library package remapping
    if (attribute == null && !""android"".equals(resName.packageName)) {
      attribute = items.get(resName.withPackageName(packageName));
      if (attribute != null) {
        attribute = new Attribute(resName, attribute.value, resName.packageName);
      }
    }
    return attribute;
  }
```

I have managed to fix my issue by changing that function to:

``` java
  @Override public Attribute getAttrValue(ResName resName) {
    resName.mustBe(""attr"");
    Attribute attribute = items.get(resName);

    // yuck. hack to work around library package remapping

      if (attribute != null && (!""android"".equals(attribute.contextPackageName))) {
        attribute = new Attribute(resName, attribute.value, resName.packageName);
      }
    }
    return attribute;
  }
```

where just the conditions of the if sentences differ from the original function. The function already contained a work around and i don't fully understand the details of the robolectric code and android library package remapping (as for the comment). But the problem seemed to be related to mixing criteria over package naming on the resource vs. attribute and that's what i have tried to change. It does not seem to break any of the robolectric tests but maybe there could be some problems with my fix that i cannot foresee. Maybe you robolectric experts can confirm that the patch is good.

And, of course, if the patch is good i will love to see the fix included on the next release ;)

2501,"The root cause of this is that it is not generally possible to answer a question like ""how much memory is a process using?"" in a straightforward way on Linux, because Linux caches the hell out of anything processes might be sharing to improve performance. (See Viacheslav Biriukov's [excellent series on the Linux Page Cache](https://biriukov.dev/docs/page-cache/7-how-much-memory-my-program-uses-or-the-tale-of-working-set-size/#how-much-memory-my-program-uses-or-the-tale-of-working-set-size) for more.)

Memory `Used by session` is currently measured by reading a value -- specifically `VmRSS` -- from `/proc/self/statm`. From the `proc` man page:

> VmRSS: Resident set size. Note  that the value here is the sum of RssAnon, RssFile, and RssShmem...
>
> RssAnon: Size of resident anonymous memory...
>
> RssFile: Size of resident file mappings...
>
> RssShmem: Size of resident shared memory (includes  System  V  shared  memory,  mappings  from tmpfs(5), and shared anonymous mappings).

Unfortunately, `RssShmem` is by definition shared across multiple processes, as is anything in `RssFile` that ends up in the page cache. So if you add up the `VmRSS` value across all processes, you will considerably exceed actual system memory. Only `RssAnon` is ([mostly](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66593890)) scoped to an individual process.

Memory `Used by system` is determined differently depending on whether we detect that we're inside a memory-restrictive cgroup or not (leaving aside that on any systemd-based distribution we are *always* inside a cgroup).

When we're _not_ in a restrictive cgroup, we check `/proc/meminfo` for total and available system memory and compute system usage as the difference, minus the `Used by session` value above. This is problematic because `RssShmem` and probably most of `RssFile` are really shared across processes and won't go away when your session does, so we're really overestimating the memory usage of a session here.

When we _are_ in a restrictive cgroup, we use `memory.usage_in_bytes`. What does that actually contain? From the kernel's docs on [cgroup Memory Ownership](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#memory-ownership):

> A memory area is charged to the cgroup which instantiated it [..] A memory area may be used by processes belonging to different cgroups. To which cgroup the area will be charged is [sic] in-deterministic

In other words, the overestimation due to including `RssShmem` and `RssFile` is now much, much worse, because we are counting memory shared among processes in other cgroups and attributing it to our session, while at the same time scoping the ""system"" to a single cgroup. In this light, it's not surprising to see a negative `Used by system` value.

Finally, with the current implementation, the meaning of ""system"" and ""available"" memory is **completely different** inside and outside a cgroup:

* Outside a cgroup we show `MemAvailable` from `/proc/meminfo` -- which is a loose estimate of actual memory available on that machine for use by a program like the session -- and attribute the remainder to the ""system"".

* Inside a cgroup we do the opposite: we estimate ""system"" memory from current in-cgroup usage and imply to users that the remainder (up to the cgroup memory limit) *is available for use by the session*. But there's no reason to believe that this is generally true: only in the narrow case of ""[on Kubernetes with a memory request equal to a memory limit](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/#create-a-pod-that-gets-assigned-a-qos-class-of-guaranteed)"" will that amount of memory be truly available for a session. On a more traditional cgroup setup -- say, when running RStudio or Workbench as a unit under systemd, which uses cgroups -- there may be a high or unrestricted memory limit, but that doesn't mean an unlimited amount of memory is available.

In sum: I don't really think we can fix this by making `Used by session` a more apples-to-apples comparison inside a cgroup to `VmRSS` from `/proc/self/statm`.

Instead, I think we would need a much more careful estimate of memory used and available inside a container, perhaps with a different UI.",1,1,prediction_comments_rstudio.csv

1. It happens intermittently, but the likelihood of happening is apparently bigger when:
a. I rerun a certain code chunk after changing it.  (If I run the whole `Rmd` file from top to bottom after restarting R, the error is unlikely to occur); and
b. When the code chunk has intended `ggplot` output in it, but also with trying to show a dataframe.
2. The workaround is that I restart R and rerun the whole `Rmd` file from the top code chunk But after doing this a few times because the error occurs a few times, RStudio may say that it is forced to restart (the message with a little bomb);
3. It indiscriminately happens to all `Rmd` files; and

1) Is there a way we can help or influence the acceptance of that change in Electron?
2) Is there a completely different way we can support how links get opened, or how previews are displayed, or...?
3) (This sounds like a terrible option, but...) is there a way we can disable links in the viewer, for now?  With some kind of message about how you should open the rendered file separately if you want to test the links?  That sounds awful.

The problem might be more fundamental, the impact might be bigger.

Encoding problems arise elsewhere as well:

I might have falsely blamed R-DBI for a strange encoding problem that occurs only running chunks in RStudio but not while Knitting: https://github.com/r-dbi/odbc/issues/489

```

I've used the attached UTF-8 text files (.txt extension, just to be able to attach them here). The original UTF-8 version is **""test-hex.R""**. I opened and ""save-as"" from several text editors. Except for the native **R Editor**, which corrupts UTF-8 chars with ""save as"", WinMerge confirms that **all others are identical UTF-8 BOM files**.

* Notepad++: ""test-hex-npp.R""
* EditPad:  ""test-hex-ep.R""
* VS Code:  ""test-hex-vsc.R""
* R Editor:  ""test-hex-rEditor.R"" - ""Save as"" corrupts UTF-8 chars, writes a Windows-1252 encoded file
* RStudio:  ""test-hex-rStudio.R""

I used Notepad++ (and of course Win10 clipboard) to copy/paste the test code between apps and consoles.

* I detect **no** corruption from this Notepad++/Win10 combination.

I tested 3 actions in both R and RStudio:

1. open and run the test-hex.R code
1. paste into editor, select and run the test code
1. paste directly into console to run the test code

**Expected results for each action:**
```

Some really interesting points. I agree having Rstudio only without Copilot is not a bad problem to have. It's much easier to learn and use for ad hoc analyses python. I don't use R for anything production.

I think this change from label to number must be, if necessary, in the render process of the file, never in the editing.

20167,"I am curious - Is the change from qtwebengine to electron certainly going to happen? My main concern is in two domains.

1) In my experience (and others, it seems), electron is a resource hog. With say, slack and signal running; the cumulative memory usage of the two are about 2.5gb of ram. 2.5 gb. Slack alone varies between 480mb to 1gb. Electron has also had some gnarly memory and cpu usage bugs on linux (that were fixed, after a long time of ignoring the issue, if I recall correctly): When using global menus, it would saturate all cores on a CPU, then all the ram (literally, 16gb/16gb of ram, over time). Again, this particular bug was fixed, but it took them several months (iirc) to acknowledge it as their problem. Regardless, even now it is using an enormous amount of memory across the electron processes just to show a webpage. It uses less ram to just visit, e.g., slack in chrom(ium) or firefox via their webpage, than it does to use the electron-powered app.

2) Packaging electron apps is awful. I'm one of a few people who package rstudio-desktop and rstudio-server for arch linux in the AUR. I also once packaged other tools that used electron, or transitioned to using electron. I have since dropped those electron packages, largely because the build process was so poorly documented and difficult, that I couldn't justify the time spent maintaining it. This is *particularly true* when you want to use the *system* electron package, rather than include electron with every single electron app. But this was *still true* even when shipping each package with its own electron libs.

*IF* the rstudio team is indeed set on using electron, rather than qtwebengine or something else, I just humbly request two things. First: Please monitor the resource usage in a fair way - Electron has built quite a reputation for soaking resources, and this is a valid criticism. Especially when you're dealing with in-memory analytics languages, minimal wasted memory usage is extremely important. Second: Please, please make the build system *very* simple and *very* well documented, especially with respect to electron. Please make it dead-simple (and *without* requiring root access and imposing side-effects, as the previous /opt/rstudio-tools approach did), or make it easy to incorporate a system-installation version into it (so that distro maintainers can just list electron as a dependency, and the package maintainer can just include links where appropriate).

I greatly appreciate all that you do; I am just concerned about the use of Electron from a resource perspective, and especially from a packaging perspective.

20375,"> What happens if we just back out the change that introduced this (#5232)?

Then I think we'd reintroduce this:

https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/5222

which was fairly ugly as well.

Looking again, it looks like the problem here just might be that we're not using boost::thread the ""right"" way on Windows. This is where we try to stop the thread by interrupting and detaching it:

https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/blob/de0b176a6afd48792c74109032f13a15586fbdf8/src/cpp/core/system/file_monitor/FileMonitor.cpp#L630-L641

Note the caveats for calling `interrupt()`, from https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/doc/html/thread/thread_management.html#thread.thread_management.tutorial.interruption:

> If *this refers to a thread of execution, request that the thread will be interrupted the next time it enters one of the predefined interruption points with interruption enabled, or if it is currently blocked in a call to one of the predefined interruption points with interruption enabled .

However, the monitor thread on Windows loops with `::SleepEx()` here:

https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/blob/de0b176a6afd48792c74109032f13a15586fbdf8/src/cpp/core/system/file_monitor/Win32FileMonitor.cpp#L597-L612

So the right fix might be to either:

1. Use Boost's APIs for sleeping the thread;
2. Use `interruption_point()` to explicitly allow the thread to check for an interrupt.

I'll trial one of these -- if it works, I think that's safe enough for v1.3.

Sadly I can't test in 20.04 because it's bizarrely [incompatible with my machine](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-release-upgrader/+bug/1883153) :(

TBH given how unlikely it is that someone else is similarly unable to upgrade, and given Ron's setup is prettymuch vanilla current linux, maybe this isn't worth dev time and I'll just suck it up?

Edit - my bad chaps, it turns out that somehow doubleclicking R files opened them in RStudio yet R files had no default program association in my OS yet.

I tested passing this in my container using a dirty patch to always add adding the parameters `service_args=[""--host=all""]` to the service instantiation, and it resolves the problem mentioned above.

1938,"Sure enough, the `goog:loggingPrefs` value requires the driver to have logging turned on, and the current behavior doesn't allow that without using `--log-path` to driver.

### Selenium 4.9.0
* `--log-path=FILE` turns on logging, respects the log levels in loggingPrefs map, sends it to that file
* `--log-level=LEVEL` without log-path turns on logging, overrides the log levels in loggingPrefs map, sends it to the console

### Selenium 4.10.0
* `--log-path=FILE` turns on logging, does not respect anything in loggingPrefs map
* `--log-level=LEVEL` without log-path still has default logging set to dev/null and does not respect anything in loggingPrefs map

### Options:
1. Selenium updates code to not go to dev/null when log level is set but log file is not. This isn't really related to the problem specified, but is a place where intent is not being respected --> Yes

2. Selenium updates code to add a default log level when a log file is specified. Whatever level chosen would override what is set in loggingPrefs and would either be more or less than desired --> Probably Not?

3. Selenium restores previous `withLogFile()` behavior and adds support to sending the whole process to a log file with a second method of `withLogOutput()` that takes a File name --> Maybe?

4. User sets `withLogFile()` and `withLogLevel()` and accepts all logging the way it comes in --> Probably good enough for this use case?

5. User obtains logs the way they are theoretically intended to be accessed using: `LogEntries logs = driver.manage().logs().get(""performance"")`, but we actually removed support for this in grid (#10949), so that is somewhat inconsistent as well. Really this is a mismatch of if Selenium isn't going to support it remotely, it really should be set in the driver and not the options, which is frustrating --> A pain, but can also filter out things not desired as desired.

Namely, actions builder calls `BeanToJsonConverter` which uses reflection and iterates all _properties_ of given java bean (which WebDriver actually is *not* supposed to be) to save them in JSON format.

### On a more serious note
I'm sure the OP was drive-by troll exasperated in frustration.  But, if that experience is common, maybe a constructive conversation about the docs on seleniumhq.org is needed?  (If that is already underway somewhere, please send me off and ignore the rest of this post :)

The docs at http://www.seleniumhq.org/ are indeed lacking and are woefully out of sync with the current state of the codebase (yet somehow newbies seem to consistently onboard themselves successfully).

This is perhaps because the project has spawned a nice little collection of authors and training services who produce their own learning material.  In a quick Amazon search, I see 63 books available solely about ""Selenium Webdriver"". That's pretty good! If you add on the dozens of training courses and the materials they produce, the Selenium user groups and archives, and thousands of StackOverflow questions/answers... that's a big honkin' load of resources you can learn from!  Arguably, much better and broader than anything the Selenium project volunteers could cobble together on their own.

### We should do less

I would love to see a PR that removes about 90% of what's currently published on the seleniumhq.org site.  The docs there are much too ambitious, trying to handle stuff like best-practices, test design patterns, test philosophy, etc.

In my ideal world, for a project this size, documentation maintained by the project would just be *very* minimal ""getting started guides"" for each supported language binding.  Most (all?) official client bindings already have auto-generated API docs that are published and we can link to.  Maybe include a brief explanation of the high level architecture, and then a few links to the API docs, and that's all. Beyond that, let the commercial documentation (books/training material) fill the gap of hand-holding newbies and teaching proper testing.

Any contributor's time spent writing/maintaining docs, is time taken away from what could otherwise have been spent fixing bugs, adding features, writing internal unit/integration tests, and keeping compatibility with the ever-changing browser landscape.  Considering the disproportionate size of users to contributors, I don't really want much time spent by developers maintaining prose explanations on tangential testing subjects to hand-hold newbie end-users.  

The repo's source code is generally well structured and pretty readable. Beyond that, The test suites are pretty comprehensive (which trumps good docs anyday in my book) and can be used to understand how various parts of the API actually work.  Beyond that, the healthy FOSS ecosystem around this project is already providing opportunities for 3rd party technical writers to write commercial or free (one can wish) books for the newb case.

I totally disagree... When reporting a bug, you should drop all human emotion, period.  It's not despicable at all to suggest that.  You want to convey the most precise set of steps to reproduce an issue and give any related technical details.  Injecting your emotions into the bug report just adds noise.

As it is right now, I still need to verify that the item in the dropdown is the one I'm expecting, regardless of whether selenium is willing to return it or not. So, I'm currently forced to use jquery to get the dropdown elements and run a javascript filter function to see if the text matches. Perhaps this functionality was well-intentioned to prevent offscreen text from coming back, but it's a pain in the butt to work with. For anything that can overflow, it makes the Text property useless.

You didn't specify the version of geckodriver you are using.  I suspect your issue is related to that.

and a comment on reporting issues:
Don't ever post screenshots of your code.. insert it as code-formatted text.  It is pretty frustrating to deal with an image because there is no way to copy code from it.  For someone to reproduce the issue, they would need to type the entire code themselves rather than just copying it from a nice text example.  Also, your screenshot only shows part of the code and a small portion of the output.  So to reproduce this, someone would need to blindly guess what you are doing in the rest of the code.  Why make someone guess when you can just paste *all* of it?  You also only included a small snippet of output.  The stacktrace in the output is probably the most important piece of information for debugging.  Why not provide the entire output?

As for sneakernet, it is pretty well locked down here.  No discs, no thumb drives, etc. allowed (even recognized) on the corporate workstations/laptops.

As for building it my self I am not a java or c++ jock and would have a learning curve I can't afford right now, so that's not practical at the moment.
But I'll see if there is someone available who can do it.

And will definately pursue getting corporate security to let that 'PUS' get through.

Thanks much for your help!!

@pathttps://github.com/pat,
see comments below:

This doesn't help us download the jar.

I know... It was not my intention to help you download the file. I was providing information about what causes the issue (since it comes up so often). But seriously, why can't you hop on a computer that's not protected by your corporate virus scanner, download the jar, and sneakernet it onto your test system?

Is there a way we can get a standalone jar that doesn't include RC at all?

Not from the selenium maintainers... But you can clone the repo, prune the RC code, and build it yourself (It's open source afterall). You might need to tweak some build configuration, but it's pretty trivial to do your own custom build.

41821,"@titusfortner - to reproduce, you need to use at least 2 instances of Safari. The bug is prevalent to those of us running parallel_tests gem it would seem.  

```
Setup 
* Configure Safari to open in private mode (Safari --> Preferences --> 'Safari Opens With: A new private window'


1. open terminal and run command # open -n -a Safari
2. Navigate to any website in that instance (say http://www.yelp.com/)
3. In terminal run the command # open -n -a Safari
4. Your new 'private' instance knows all about your other instance haha.
You can verify (see the shared cookies) by using the Web Inspector.
```

You will notice that this second instance, despite being private - will share all non-session cookies that are present in the first instance. Moreover, it starts you off at the webpage you are on in the first instance.

Cookies will be cleared when ALL browsers have been closed. Any time a new Safari is opened without fully quitting all other instances, you will see this ugly shared behaviour - which makes Parallel testing very sad. 

Things get really weird when you start opening new windows with multiple instances. The cookies will be shared between windows on the same level, but not between. So all instances of window 2 will share cookies, and same for all instances of window 1. But Window 1 & 2 (within an instance, or between) will not share cookies. 

Crazy stuff!

So I don't see when anyone would ever expect to send a hash as an argument, and return that _same object_ back.

However, you stated that is _already_ supports hashes, and I was under the impression this did not work. So I need to revisit my work to see why it failed when I attempted this very thing.

If this works:

```
driver.execute_script(""return arguments[0].a === 1"", {""a"" => 1}) # ==> true

I can't tell what method SoapUI is using, sorry.

I'm not entirely sure what kind of parallel you're running your tests. We do run our test sequentially but for example one Test SoapUI one Selenium then SoapUI again. We do not run SoapUI and Selenium at the same time. That's why above workaround works for us.

If I remember correctly what you're describing is pretty much what we do: We save the default ProxySelector to some static variable when initializing our Selenium-Testrunner (before initializing SoapUI I think) and then reset it using `ProxySelector.setDefault(proxy);` before each Selenium-Test. But that only works reliable if you're not running SoapUI and Selenium at the same time (you'd propably run into some pretty nasty timing stuff here if you do)...

If you're using both in parallel the proper solution would be to force Selenium and SoapUI to use different httpclients I guess...
If running into this situation I'd maybe even head over to the guys at smartbear and file a bug against SoapUI for setting the default ProxySelector to null...don't know if this is legitimate.

Hope that clears up things a little...

The problem isn't that you had a bug in your database import/export. The problem is that you haven't provided users an easy way to unblock themselves. You know Google takes it's sweet time approving and rolling out updates yet you still don't have any forwards/backwards compatibility code that would allow the export of the database in an older format.

Signal got too big and too popular, and so somebody decided to limit it, and bribed or threatened the devs to destroy it, coming up with a very effective strategy of removing existing functional features to make it unusable by the majority of non-technical users.

It's also possible they took over the project, hiring bad actors to contribute until they controlled, and again sabotaged it from the inside.

Either way, it it my opinion that ""An enemy has done this"" is the most reasonable explanation for the high-handed and implacable destruction of the signal private messenger we all knew and loved.

There have been plenty of people on the forum offering alternatives that would improve those issues with people accidentally using SMS (why did they enable it?) or not knowing it was insecure. **It seems like the developers just think that their non-techie userbase are the stupidest people in the world.** The stupidest people that would be willing/able to now use multiple messaging apps and determine the correct contacts for each app without just throwing up their hands and getting rid of signal altogether.


The 2 other points mentioned on the forum were

1) MMS is hard to support because many device/telecom pairs function differently with MMS messages. They mention SMS is hard, but that code is rarely touched; the MMS stuff is the problem

I can't dispute this because I haven't dug through the MMS code. If it is consuming so much time that you can't do anything else then maybe its time to reduce support for it, or restructure the code for it. That is a much better use of time than alt coins, stickers, or stories.

2) RCS is upcoming to replace SMS


RCS is a new standard that google is pushing, but the problem is that Apple has already publicly stated they will not support it. So we're down to just walled gardens - Android to Android could communicate with RCS in the future when it is mature and implementations are available (which they aren't now, still in limited beta). Apple to Apple can already do this with iMessage, but it downgrades to SMS when talking to Android. Sounds like every other messaging app, convince all of your friends to join the same app or else you don't get to use any of our cool features.

Why can't Signal keep SMS / MMS and become the go to for cross platform secure communication? Its already been getting more popular with android users that can take advantage of the **opportunistic encryption** as they convert more of their contacts. We're in a position that we can do what Apple and Google refuse to do, we can make a single app that communicate with both Apple and Android devices with rich text.

**I guess to me it comes down to what the goal is for the app and company.** 

If the goal is security and privacy at all costs, then SMS is a hindrance and so are those pesky users that don't fear for their lives everyday. Afraid of people finding out who they talk to and what they say. I think the equivalent would be if TOR decided they were only going to support onion sites from now on and they were going to kill their exit nodes. That would kill the TOR network for most users and they could make the same argument - exit nodes are the weakest point in TOR and by cutting support they would be improving the network security and privacy. Except they would also cut down traffic to just those individuals that need the security and put a giant red flag on anyone using TOR.

If the goal is to build a communications platform that will allow users to gradually improve their privacy and security, one day at a time. If  the end goal is to get encrypted and private communications out to everyone in the world, then we need to be able to get that foot in the door. We need to be able to say if you use this app you can still communicate with non-signal users and whenever they add the app your communications will automatically be upgraded. For those users that can't have stray SMS messages going out for cost or security, we could just default the setting to off and make sure they are aware of what turning it on means.

You could make it into an option instead of deciding for everybody that they don't want or need it.
Sending myself SMS is the best way to get personal notifications because I don't have reliable Internet 24/7 everywhere I go, but there usually is enough service to receive texts.

Making it available as an opt-in function would solve the spam campaign problem while not screwing people who have relied on it until now. Please don't make people downgrade the Signal app just because of this. I will downgrade if I have to, but I really don't want to.

Edit: sorry if I seem angry. I have been going crazy trying to see if my service provider was messing up somehow because I missed some important notifications (someone logged in my server and I should have received a text, but I didn't because of this), and now I see that it was not a bug but done on purpose. I know I'm a part of a tiny group of users using APIs to send myself texts, but this feature has been very useful for the past few years and Signal has been nothing short of amazing, until now.

Edit2: Looking at the forum posts, you only mention server notifications that can be done via Internet.
This supposes supposes that the person is always connected to the Internet or does not need to be urgently alerted.
If someone manages to log on my server, I need an instant notification to be able to shut it down. SMS notifications have the highest chances of reaching me, because I often don't have Internet on my phone.

I'm saying that Signal supports people *with* Play Services, and we support people *without* Play Services. We do not support people with *possibly altered maybe broken* Play Services.

I would personally value this (SMS/MMS) feature as worth thousands of dollars, but at this rate, I guess they're never going to see a penny from me and they just want to settle for being a measly WhatsApp wannabe with a fraction of the userbase.

Not yet, and i haven't even started on android yet as I mainly use signal as a desktop client, I do have instructions for rolling back to 5.3 successfully on desktop and preventing it from being updated (my build is 5 days past expire date and is functioning properly).

You will need to create daily backups of %APPDATA%\signal to %APPDATA\signal.color.backup and occasionally restore from this backup because your phone will occasionally force everyone else blue.

9631,"Major breakthrough! This has been occurring on and off for years. It also manifests as a failure to make a ping sound when a text message is received. I finally believe I know how to work around it. Furthermore, my workarounds should enable someone with the source code to find the bug:

1. Reinstall Signal. This is a terrible option because (a) you will lose all your history and (b) you'll need the SIM that you used to register your Signal number, which should be different from your actual number for obivous security and flexibility reasons. As soon as the registration SMS arrives (assuming you even still have the registration SIM in working order), it's like flashing a giant neon sign over your head that says ""Dear World: the person with this Signal number is standing right here at this GPS.""

2. Update Signal manually (if it's not automatically updated) via Google Play (or the App Store if this also occurs with the iOS version). This will fix the problem for a while as well, completely independent of what the update actually changes. Already using the latest version? You're screwed until the next one comes out.

...and then, in a matter of weeks to months, it will randomly go into no-notification mode again.

The implications are quite clear: Signal's datastore gets either corrupted or desynchronized with the OS such that only an upgrade or reinstall fixes the problem. I would imagine that it's quite easy for the Signal team to figure out what sort of reinitialization occurs upon an upgrade, which would then reveal the particular part of the state that's getting wonky.

Meanwhile, if this can't be root caused, then it would be greatly helpful to have a menu option that says ""fix broken notifications"". Either that, or every time you open the app, it tells the OS ""for the millionth time, I want my damn notifications enabled!""

This is probably the worst and longest lived Signal bug. It literally destroys its utility as a messaging app. I realize there are 1200 open issues (many of which being duplicates, but still). Nevertheless, the significance of fixing this one particular issue can hardly be understated.

Friends have shouted at me, colleagues have been pissed off, and family members have assumed that I've been neglecting them, all because of this fucking bug. Enough is enough.

Other than this and a few other crashes my biggest pet peeve lately is that users can no longer edit forwarded messages... Really?

10255,"# Hello Community,

I've experienced that bug too, after accidentally removing the Google DocumentsUI..  

## Context - Intro 
I tried this night a bit around, due to the Signal Bug (you cant export/backup your messages without DocumentsUI.apk by Google - which is a poor Design... but maybe a deep design decision is behind it)
I tried all of the following steps with a S10 device. 

## ::: Fixing the shit ::: 
First of all... you need root (otherwise a cache clear is mostly enough, since the app itself isn't fully removed from the system)

**Plugin your Phone via USB and Debugging Enabled - If already done SKIP** 
On your Phone UI: 
Software Informations -> Build Version press x times on it -> popup Message ""You're now a developer"" appears (or something like that)
Back to Settings:  enable USB Debugging, authorize your phone - this might be different for different android versions and devices!
I assume you already have ADB installed on your PC and you have likely a **rooted phone**, under linux (your PC in this case) just write apt-get install adb -y and you're fine (surely with sudo / root)
Then you can check it with adb devices, it should list your phone.

**First try a simple:**
1. adb shell, then enter ""su"" (opens a root shell)
2. try a pm install-existing com.google.android.documentsui
This ONLY works if the apk is not corrupt (see belooow) and still is still in the priv-app Directory.

**10 Steps to fix your DocumentsUI and Signal:** 
1. **adb devices** (check if the device is listed, if not... you might have other problems :) )
2. **adb shell**  (open a linux shell on your golden eye == on your PHONE)
3. Type in **""su""** (to get root); verify with ""**whoami**"" (should return ""root"" == a ROOT SHELL)
4. **cd /system && echo ""test"" > /system/ && rm /system/test**   (to **test if it returns read only ;)** - checks if the /system dir is writable )
5. **mount -o rw,remount /** (**NOT /SYSTEM; DO THIS ONLY IF READONLY,** **it remounts the partition and enables writing)**
6. **cd /system/priv-app/**  (enter the priv-app directory, which may differ depending on your manufacturer and Android Version) 
7. **./find | grep -i DocumentsUI** Then enter that directory (Lists the Directories which contain DocumentsUI, it's case-INSENSITIVE, enter it...) In my case it was locate under: /system/priv-app/DocumentsUIGoogle/DocumentsUIGoogle.apk 
8. **pm install --user 0 DocumentsUIGoogle.apk** (in the root shell, ofc; Does the installation for SYSTEMWIDE)
9. **pm install  DocumentsUIGoogle.apk** (in the root shell, ofc; Does the installation for USERSPECIFIC)
10. **It should return ""success**"". Otherwise do some throubleshooting 
11. **enter ""reboot"" it restarts your phone** 
verify it's all fine by opening Signal.. do the backup OTHERWISE... See below or use your favorite Search Engine.
**WINNER-WINNER-CHICKEN-DINNER ;)** 

**In case of any head->wall banging events.. (For your own safety ;) ):**
When you get ""INTERNAL_ERROR"" or ""SIGNATURE_VERIFICATION_FAILED"", you should consult your favorite Android Modding Forum and your favorite Search Engine. 
In my case it was possible to disable VERIFICATION by setting a ENV VARIABLE.
I also had to purge multiple times the DocumentsUIGoogle (com.google.android.documentsui) from the system... 
Idk anymore how the solution to INTERNAL_ERROR was, I guess it was ""--user 0"" at the ""pm install""-cmd.

## ::: Additional Nice2Know :::
In my case this APK File on the phone was corrupt after my accidental removal action :o
Lets fix it :) 
1. Download some Stock Image for your device... AND take the AP(.tar) out of a compressed archive (usually)
2. Extract it (tar -xvz AP.tar system.img.lz4 && lz4 -d system.img.lz4 && simg2img system.img out.img)
3. Mount the shit: mkdir tmpfs; mount -o loop out.img tmpfs; (now you see a mointpoint in that directory - therefore it should be empty)
4. Now grab the APK cd tmpfs && cp system/priv-app/DocumentsUIGoogle/DocumentsUIGoogle.apk <<Destination?>>
5. Download it to your phone (how you do that is your choice... I've used ncat on the phone, which seems to be preinstalled)
6. pm install --user 0 DocumentsUIGoogle.apk
Don't forget to replace the APK in /system/priv-app/DocumentsUIGoogle/DocumentsUIGoogle.apk 

## FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY ::: YOU NEED SOME EXPERIENCE TO DO IT. BUT IT'S POSSIBLE! :) 
I read some Posts in Blogs / Forums where some users recommend a reset of the device, which is NOT needed. 

/E: Litte readability corrections...  
/E3: Added reboot cmd
/E4: Tech additionals, small Corrections
/E:8123312: Forget it :D
**Notice:** keep in mind I wrote it straight forward, out of my mind.... so have fun to analyze it and use it adapted in your specific case.

Turning on auto rotate because you need landscape for 2 seconds is annoying, so some/a lot of people don't do it, and whatsapp apparently mitigates for that by enabling the sensor in camera mode, so that images shot as landscapes don't appear in portrait, because that's undesired/annoying/stupid, even though auto rotation is disabled globally.

yes, you are absolutely right! in the moment of posting i thought ""shit, i forgot the log!"" and after an call it was completely out of my brain!

now i wanted to capture the log with adb and found out that the setting works! it only took a while!

i had set the backup directory to my pretty well filled download folder. maybe the ""problem"" is the large number of files.

I know it is not a bug (registration worked), but there still might be an overlook. You shouldn't accumulate a queue of hours when the app can't stay connected more than 5 minutes waiting for the verification code. Also, it is looking like the app sends a verification code request every time you reopen it. No bug but if this is putting a server on its knee, then there is a problem.

Hopefully this is the only time this is going to manifest itself.

I'm not going to shorten my report, everything I wanted to say is there, and I wanted to convey how a basic user will try to interact with the app. It may not be funny to you, but being waken up at 3:30 am by calls from servers may not be funny neither, yet I laughed.

Performance is so bad that ppl are now pissed enough to just not use Signal anymore. Instead of providing useless new Features which slow down Signal even more, just fix that damn thing first. Even on a Pocophone F1, which isnt that slow, Signal just eats all Resources for a few seconds till messages are sent. In a really long Chat (90k Messages), that can take around 20-30 secs.

Hell even those thumbs up here on GitHub are yellow. This was something generally agreed on by unicode I think when they standardized emojis. Yellow was cjosen as a neutral color.

Greyson also seems to think that yellow is racist, so I assume he actually wants to replace yellow with multiple skin colors.

To answer a question form Geysons first reply, I think it would make sense if emojis of all colors are brought together in one badge. Either multiple thumbs behind each other and randomly decide which one is the first one, or just single thumb icon which used one if the skin tones at random. After all the point is that people gave a thumbs up. All people are equal. Why would we keep the same hand gesture but in sn other skin tope seperate? I thought that sort of seperation is something from the past (where people of color had a seperate toilet or eaiting room). Let's not seoerate tgem in their own badge, they are equal and skin tone is not of any importance to be highlited as differerent.

- Now the status *does* match A, and A will collapse down.

So from the user's perspective, they sent a message, and then a moment later, a bunch of stuff collapsed down. It looks jittery, and we didn't want it. I used delivery receipts in this example, but same applies to read receipts.

There are perhaps more complex things we could do like not collapsing things until you leave the thread and come back, but that gets super tricky/ugly to implement, and we decided to keep it simple. Either way, feel free to continue discussion on the forum.

Meanwhile the situation got mysteriously even worse. 

I reconnected the Signal App on my old phone (without doing any other change to this phone) and have the same problem there now too! So all I did was switching the connection on again and register it again. I did not even use any other app or change any other setting in the mean time. Everything was fine before I stopped the Signal registration and is now weird with just registering it again... 

(((Btw. I was thinking what I probably did differently than ""the average person"" 
- both phones are not able to receive SMS so I used the call option to verify the number
- both phones have the location service(s) switched off
- Google Play services have all rights except location (but the Google App has only the rights for mircrophone and telephone)
- both phones were only on Wifi not mobile data
- both phones started with the issue as they started to use some pre existing data instead of starting from the scratch (but the problem stayed after it first appeared even with a new try from the scratch)

Come to think of it, most of us privacy hawks would be willing to hand you some cryto coin for the privilege of avoiding SMS. It's a practical problem also, not just a security problem. What happens when for whatever reason you need to reinstall Signal outside of your wireless provider's region? Or if you lose your phone including your SIM while outside that region? It's hell.

Not sure if you were on the wifi or the cellular at 12:04 thru 12:14 when the first debuglog ends, but whichever one it was, did NOT have strong/actual internet connectivity.  Your second debuglog starts at 12:17 a few minutes later, and immediately has a bunch of exceptions which seem pertinent to the bad behavior:

Its definitely a bug in the websokets implementation and under android 9/lineage 16 the os constantly tries to open and closes the websokets. Thats the reason why the battery is sucked dry……
If my device would not posses a 3000mah battery it would not last a day.

The current workaround is, to manually disable the app an only check messages every 3 hours and then force to close it.
If its possible, it would be nice if a polling event can be manually set – like every 1 hour the  app contacts the signal servers to look for new messages.

Wouterdek, I think your issue is not related to MobileVikings but more to a mysterious company called CM (nee, niet die cm, de andere cm). I assume that somewhere, sometime you messaged STOP to a certain number because you got annoyed by the messages companies were sending. This means you blocked a lot of services without knowing it and you need to mail CM at cmsupport@cm.nl with your phonenumber and ask them to have you unblocked for commercial purposes.

Interesting. I haven't read through the entire code on the WebRTC side, but it seems like there are actually two different situations in which it calls `AudioDecoder::Decode`:
* [Internal comfort noise generator mode](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/blob/c7c411b3f354bbd5930e0c0ef9778831ecc5f329/jni/webrtc/modules/audio_coding/neteq/neteq_impl.cc#L1594), where it expects only a single frame to be output.
* [To decode an entire packet](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/blob/c7c411b3f354bbd5930e0c0ef9778831ecc5f329/jni/webrtc/modules/audio_coding/neteq/neteq_impl.cc#L1263), it calls the audio decoder in a loop.

> It sounds like @klemensbaum is saying that the upstream interface has been changed to include bounds information, so we could pull in that update if it turns out this is a problem.

That's correct.

> Or, alternatively, if it is clear that the calling code is always allocating an output buffer of a given size, we could break the abstraction layer and simply hardcode that.

Unfortunately it isn't as simple as that, as `Decode` is called in a loop (once for each packet) with a different position into the output buffer each time.

In this case, I don't believe it's possible to simply ""trust the user."" There are many *many* different ways that a user could choose to format a phone number in different regions all around the world. There are also many *many* different ways that an SMSC or MMSC could choose to format a phone number in a message that it delivers. Somehow, we need to match incoming message addresses to outgoing message addresses in order to display them in the same thread. We also need to match what's in your address book with both of those so that we can display the correct contact information for the messages in that thread. We need to account for the fact that the user, SMSC, and MMSC could choose to change how they're formatting numbers in any of those places at any point. We need to store additional state like encrypted sessions, per-contact preferences, etc and also correlate that with numbers as they're displayed in all of these places.

The only truly universal format is E164, so we canonicalize everything into E164 in order to have a sane representation that's consistent everywhere.

The only place we can't do that is with short codes, so we try to detect them and canonicalize them differently.

31685,"Those are good points. But I also think that, since the current default behavior in Signal is to prohibit screenshots until you turn off that option, it seems like Signal is sending the message that screenshots are insecure.

So I think people are surprised when they find I've taken a screenshot of their message, since they thought Signal prevented that.


Also, to be fair, a screenshot is a lot more incriminating than a text file claiming you said something in a message. Even though clearly a user could fake a screenshot through photoshop, it adds a semi-non-trivial barrier to many people.

Btw. this app was mentioned in the most popular Polish portal about security https://niebezpiecznik.pl/post/ustawa-inwigilacyjna-jak-sie-bronic-przed-podgladaniem-przez-policje-i-sluzby/
In short: our government has just implementet very controversial surveillance law so the demand for this app will raise.
So please be aware that many Polish users will start using this app and here in Poland we need unicode stripping unfortunately. All keyboard suggestions always puts word with our non-ascii chars and that sucks :(

I have Signal on several devices non rooted with stock and strong wifi connection. Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Nexus 6P, Samsung 6, Samsung 4 and on every phone, the call quality is really horrible and the volume is fucked up. 

I recently tested several other apps for calling with zrtp and they are way better than Signal. For example Simlar. Or StrukturAG Messenger webrtc on iphone and Chrome on Android.

Here is what it looks like in simlar. Call quality is determined with how good the inet connection is. They are based on Linphone.

Look at the screenshot above. In simlar you can hit the ? button so it can show you how good the interent connection is and what codec and so on. Maybe Signal does not recognize the actual connection quality  at the moment the call is done or whatever. 

i have nearly 40 signal contacts in my contact list. I have a wifi only phone and some people just have my signal number cause i told them im out of gsm talking for several reasons. I totally enforced signal on all my friends that want to communicate with me. Every one of them has 10+ contacts in his list and i don't know of anybody NOT complaining about call quality and volume.

- registration process
- reminder (only the one that suggests registering to Signal messages and calls)

IMHO the native Android Emoji experience is bad because it is very inconsistent.

HTC Android devices are using their own HTC Emoji set, Samsung Android devices are using their own Samsung Emoji set, LG Android devices are using their own LG Emoji set, Google Android devices (Nexus) are using their own Google Emoji set and so on...

Everyone sees different Emojis. That just sucks. Especially because of the issue which is described in the following article:

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/27/emoji-meaning_n_5530638.html

In TextSecure however, all the users are seeing the same Emojis, which makes for a much better Emoji experience.

> And also it is not true that TextSecure makes sure that the Emojis seen on emitter and recipient phones are the same. Just tried with 2.22.2 version to my lady who didn't update: she sees the Google Emojis while I have the ugly Apple ones. 

That is your fault. If you are using 2.22.2 at the moment, then you are on the beta release channel, since 2.22.2 has not yet been released to the stable release channel.

Your ""lady"" probably is using the stable release channel though, which means she is still using 2.21.0, which means she has not yet been updated to the new Emojis.

Once she will update to 2.22.x, she will see the same Emojis that you are seeing.

So, it's not TextSecure's fault. It's yours (because you are using a beta version).

> 
> Why on earth did you switch to Apple emojis?!

Well, I can not speak for the TextSecure developers, but:

IMHO the Google ""Noto Color Emoji"" Emoji set looks like shi*.

Let's face it, most people (or at least a lot), do not like the Google ""Noto Color Emoji"" Emoji set.

If you don't believe me, then maybe you should read the comments in the following two issues on the AOSP issue tracker:

https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=69755
https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=73248

And maybe you should also read the comments in the following XDA-Developers forum thread:

http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2722892

The Apple Emoji set looks a heck of a lot better and is much more popular than the Google ""Noto Color Emoji"" Emoji set.

The Apple Emoji set is being used in Telegram, ICQ, WhatsApp and so on... (just to name a few examples)

And even the Twitter ""Twemoji"" Emoji set and the Emoji One Emoji set clearly are modelled after the Apple Emoji set.

So, it's quite popular and therefore pretty much is the natural choice.

Also, Signal-iOS (the iOS counterpart to TextSecure) of course uses the Apple Emoji set, since all iOS devices are using it natively.

So, now that TextSecure for Android also uses the Apple Emoji set, the Emoji experience is much more consistent across both platforms, which lessens the risk of Emojis getting lost in translation as described in the following article:

:see_no_evil: Java and Android's date processing stuff is junk. We switched to `SimpleDateFormat` because `android.text.format.DateUtils` effectively ignores every `Locale` arg it is passed and now this. All internet advice tells us to use the new Java 8 APIs or `DateFormat.getDateInstance(int,Locale)`, where `int` refers to a predefined date format string ie no custom date formats.

upon further inspection of the `SimpleDateFormat` javadoc I found _""SimpleDateFormat does not deal with the localization of text other than the pattern letters; that's up to the client of the class.""_

40560,"Generally in Java, if the canned date formats (`SHORT`, `MEDIUM`, `LONG`, `FULL`) are insufficient and you want to use a custom date format, localization is painful. Element order, punctuation, abbreviations, prefixes/suffixes, etc. all vary wildly between languages and their respective date forms.  Developers are usually left to one of three options:
1. Create a separate format string for each locale (shoot me now)
2. Use a library like those in [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org/)
3. Settle for ugly localization and hope for the best (Signal's current state)

Android 4.3 (API 18, `JELLY_BEAN_MR2`) [added a method](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/format/DateFormat.html#getBestDateTimePattern%28java.util.Locale,%20java.lang.String%29) that makes option 2 native, implementing [ICU4C](https://ssl.icu-project.org/apiref/icu4c/) in the platform via JNI. On a related note, [AOSP Issue 171591](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=171591) requests adding it to the support library for compatibility with prior platforms and bugfix currency; add a star if you'd like.

44379,"Yeah I agree with @bortzmeyer, why did you deprecate this ?

At least leave the choice to the user : using push messages is not useful in every country in the world, here in France for instance we really don't care about texts messages since we can send an unlimited amount of them with every recent plan for less than a few bucks per month, so the ""avoid the fees"" argument just don't stand. And FYI, I am really more confident in the inability of my cell carrier to decipher my messages than the ability of textsecure servers to handle them fast and reliably.

Moreover, from my personal experience, textsecure push messages are really not trust worthy because it is a pain in the ass for the user to maintain a data access just to textsecure : when me or one of my contact is sick of loosing his battery in his pocket, he simply loses the texts he may receive from another textsecure user until he gets internet again. And do not talk me about subscribing and unsubscribing to push messages every time, this is as painful.

I don't know for other users, but you can be sure this is not the push capabilities of textsecure which attracted me at first glance, and this is is still not the case.

I'm starting to see, that this creates a uncomfortable feelings for my contacts, because they don't know if I have really received the message.
For me, as it is now, I can only use Textsecure with people who are aware of these reliability problems.

Some contacts I have sporadic communication. To miss out on one of these sporadic messages would be horrible. Missed chances, potential ruined relationships...
I got my close circle to switch to Textsecure and Redphone, but as it is right now, I'll have to switch over to Whatsapp, that I reluctantly started using.

I do cherish Redphone/Textsecure and the upcoming (finally) Signal suite. Unfortunately I have spent so much time in explaining, trouble shooting, being angry because of missed messages, disconnects, that it looks like an utopian dream right now.

If there's anything I can do to help making it more reliable, I have a lot of experience using Textsecure/Redphone with partners, on VPN, crappy connections and number changes, device changes, crashes, bla blah...

45497,"@bungabunga, I agree with your point that TextSecure already is a complex tool. But can't we just add a checkbox called ""Expert-Mode"" within the settings to enable such features as proposed here?

This Issue just states the particular case of my friends and me, but imagine someone who wants to confirm some important booking confirmation like a flight (which is probably very unlikely) or other stuff that has to be confirmed by a certain word or number. What about those cases? Shouldn't the use of TextSecure still provide all the basic SMS functionality? I already see the argument coming that this Issue with the circumstances and problems mentioned in it would be a ""perfect reason"" to erase the encrypted SMS functionality. But if you really think that way, you're on a wrong path.

In my eyes, an ""Expert-Mode"" within the settings would make much sense, because many things that are yet confusing to the average chump could be put into this place. When enabling ""Expert-Mode"", a small warning could be displayed to prompt the user to get familiar with these ""dangerous"" functions and know what he is doing in the first place.

45502,"> Yes there is: eliminating encrypted SMS.

@jlund, if you want TextSecure to be like any other fucking messenger out there and people stop using it, do so. Let me ask you this: What makes TextSecure **unique** after erasing encrypted SMS? I don't get it.

@moxie0, thanks for pointing out how to contribute. I will follow along those lines from now on. But truly, not having a way of turning off the whitespace tagging is really a bummer. Wonder why noone complains, filed Issues about this before or contributed code to solve this problem (which is common in Germany).
",1,1,prediction_comments_signalandroid.csv
45511,"@SecUpwN It's their app and they should do what they want with it. If someone wants to have more options and know how to code they can fork it (maybe some day I will have the skills and time to do it and convince some people to join me) In my opinion throwing SMS support out will cause most users to forget that TextSecure exist and most people will not even install it. It will be used by geeks and people involved in the project. 
What I liked about TextSecure is that when you try to convince someone to use it you install it for them, and say to use it just like regular SMS app and that's it! (that is how I convinced most of my friends) they like it and use it! otherwise they just get rid of it after some time or don't use at all.
There are many apps that you can use for secure internet messages but TextSecure is the only one that has many users and can work like iMessage on Apple products.
In my opinion if Apple would release iMessage without SMS integration then it would be as successful as Samsung ChatON... and that what TextSecure will be without SMS support - Another WhatsApp wannabe. 
There are only two people that I really need to be sure I can contact securely over internet messages and they are using TextSecure, surespot and ChatSecure with OTR. I can use any of these apps but choose to use TextSecure since I can use it with other people too and not just via push messages but encrypted SMS too since they don't have data plan or are not always online. 
From average user point of view when you are looking for secure messenger (no SMS support necessary) which one do you choose? you will probably get votes on all the 3 with advantages and disadvantages on each one. But right now with TextSecure you get something no one else can bring to the table: SMS support! 
Are there any good alternatives for encrypted SMS out there? This is the best thing about TextSecure! you get encrypted SMS and push messages!

Example scenario: a lot of people turn off data and WIFI when their battery is low and then they are forced to communicate via SMS. Right now TextSecure is the ONLY solution (that I know of) that gives secure and transparent solution for secure communication via push and SMS in one app. Once you get rid off in-app SMS communication these users are left with no communication or insecure SMS. @moxie0 I hope the SMS support will stay since it is the best feature of TextSecure. Or that CM will release their SMS app in Play Store so other people can use it without CM installed.

45591,"@moxie0, thanks for the link and making it clear to participate there. Point is, I always respected WhisperSystems for sticking to the core killer-features it had in TextSecure. WIth even talking about erasing the best feature of TextSecure, your company makes a strong turn the other way around for me. The most difficult and confusing part is **NOT** to exchange keys, but rather to convince friends and other people to use TextSecure and not some other shitty Messenger out there. Do you know what the reason was that finally convinced me to ditch WhatsApp and switch to TextSecure? It was this awesome comparison: [Fighting DISHFIRE: The State of Mobile, Cross-Platform, Encrypted Messaging](https://missingm.co/2014/02/fighting-dishfire-the-state-of-mobile-cross-platform-encrypted-messaging/). What would @jlund say to this?

With TextSecure lacking SMS encryption, there's no point for me in continuing to use it. I don't get why you and your company even think about killing that feature if this project is open-source in the first place. What exactly is holding you back? The reasoning that the future will provide more data connections and that SMS continue to submit metadata might be a valid point, but SMS is are not going to vanish within the next 10 years, nor will I ever switch on my data connection when wanting to write to someone OFFLINE.

47388,"Yes, I am fully aware that the proper way to secure your phone is to use the lockscreen against online and the TS password for offline attacks. But most people don't realize this. 

And I don't have any statistics to point to, but a _lot_ of people simply don't set a lockscreen protection at all, mostly because they are too lazy to enter it every time they want to use the phone.
Many are reasoning that only their messages are valuable enough to be protected and that TextSecure is going to take care of that.

To me the question is what bad can it do if we protect them better? I would even vote for a pin lock for TextSecure (if no lockscreen pin/pattern is set), because of two reasons:
- people are lazy as hell and they are more likely to use a pin lock if they are asked less often (only for TS messages, not every time they use the phone)
- people don't think about the question if their whole workflow is secure, but that installing one app is enough. They don't realize that the decision not to set a lock screen password a year ago will expose their ""secure"" messages even after installing TextSecure.

I propose this kinda messy security model (in addition to the current one) because messy is exactly how humans treat security, either because they are lazy or because they don't fully understand how their decisions impact their security.

Yes, pretty much. You can of course search for other reports of this behaviour and block the known numbers. As you are from Germany, contacting your states ""Datenschutzbeauftragen"" or ""Verbraucherschutz"" is also an option.

Why the british number? Who knows. Maybe it's the cheapest way, maybe the most anonymous.

got a few suggestions though:
- if you tap to on the very fast scrolling region - not the drawer itself -  the contact gets highlighted but not selected. In the group selection as well as in single contact selection
- what if a contact got more than one number _TS registered_ (private + work)? Is it possible to show the type of number (only) in that case too
- my contacts often got about 4-5 numbers which of only one or two are SMS/TS capable (type mobile).
  would be nice to have the option to filter them out. (I don't know of anyone got a fax that is aware of SMS) The number should be shown if it is a TS registered number though...

  TEXTSECURE USERS - B...

@mcginty I think calling them TextSecure users is not a good option, because then there is no distinction between users with TS, but only SMS (for example because they don't have the Play store/GCM)

In addition I'm positive that we should not call the push directory push directory, but instead contact list or address book. As far as I can see there is no difference in the usage and the only thing the user can do with it, is to refresh/update it.

Absolutely nobody, exept the uber nerds, has ever heard of a push directory. And as long as there is no difference for the user, the technical details are of no concern to him. This is especially true for the users which use translated versions. Most of the translations just take ""push directory"" straight from the original, which leads to even more confusion.

I say this because I believe that the fallback should be related to the channel (PUSH to SMS), and not related to the level of security (ENCRYPTED to UNENCRYPTED).

The fallback, after all, is between TextSecure users, allowing remains ENCRYPTED communication independently of the channel choiced. This would be in tune with that TextSecure's principle that encrypted messages are the standard.

I would change the ""Send unencrypted"" (security fallback) to ""Send [encrypted] SMS"" (channel fallback). My 2 cents.

""Send unencrypted"", in fact, means ""**SMS unencrypted**"", and
""Send SMS"", in fact, means ""**SMS encrypted**"".

Users on either end shouldn't have to go about deregistering numbers or thinking about transport layers and switching modes to make that work. There should be zero ambiguity. Here's how I'd like to see it happen:

When TextSecure sends a message to a TextSecure recipient via push, the recipient should non-optionally push back a delivery notification as soon as it receives the message. When a sender doesn't receive a delivery status message back from a receiver within, say, ten seconds, it should pop up a notification saying ""Delivery Failed - resend over SMS?"" and with one tap, resend it via SMS and also disabling the data transport permanently for that recipient until it receives a delivery status back from them or another message over data. Don't just put these messages in to a bottle and throw them in the ocean. We figured out how to do reliable messaging over the internet a long time ago. When in doubt, emulate TCP.

Deregistering numbers is bad UI and bound to make people upset. Maybe expire people from the push directory if they haven't checked in in a few weeks, but whether or not someone has a public key in the push directory should have no impact on if they can receive texts reliably, no matter what.

That's why we will have to ask the user what he wants and if we explain it nicely with simple examples (aka lockscreen popup with picture of friend with beer in hand, asking when you'll be there, while you are explaining you'll have to leave early to support your sick child) nobody will bat an eye.
",1,1,prediction_comments_signalandroid.csv
50619,"@lindworm: I really like your idea of asking the user to choose between these levels, so he doesn't have to go through all the settings and choose the right options. In my opinion, we should make it very clear that even the first level (""high convinience + medium security"") results in a very good security level, at least way better than the security other apps like Wh**_app offer and even better than what you get from Threema (they don't have perfect forward secrecy for example). So the average user who comes from easy-to-use messengers like Wh**_app or F***book would choose the first option. Otherwise many users will probably choose the second option, although they don't really want to use security features like a passphrase.

Additionally, it would be a good idea to tell the user in a simple way what the levels mean. We could include a help function here with easy to understand use cases, maybe something like this:
- high convinience + medium security - recommended for most users: You want to chat with other users without someone being able to read your messages and it should just be easy to use (so you don't get bothered with security functions like choosing a passphrase for example).
- medium convenience + high security - for security-conscious users: Security is very important for you and you don't want anybody to be able to read your messages. Here you get additional security functions which can have some impacts on the usability.
- low convinience + paranoid security: You don't want a three-letter-agency to track you down? Or you organize protests but your government shouldn't know? This will enable all security features.

We should of course be careful giving promises here we maybe cannot hold, but this should really just give an idea of my point that the average user should be able to choose the right option for him.

Just one last point: It should be possible to change these options later on in the settings and I would also introduce ""extended settings"" in the settings, where the user can en-/ disable all security functions himself if he really wants to.

However your solution is certainly better. I still think we should stick with the three modes, but take a different approach to implement them:
- **First Question:** ""Does your personal security or life depend on keeping your messages out of reach of third parties who might be in possession of your phone?"" 
  Answers:
  **no** -> send user to the next step. 
  **yes** ->  question 2 is shown.
- **Second Question:** ""Are you _really_ in great danger?""

  ""**Yes, do everything possible to protect me**"" > Popup with explanation, that many convenient features have to be turned off and link to edit all settings
  ""**No, but I still like my privacy**""  > Popup with explanation, that it may be less convenient and link to edit all settings

@lindworm NO! It is way more confusing, because it's utterly vague. Hell, most people in this thread wouldn't know what to choose!

And I oppose that second step. There should not be a medium setting, that just gives a false sense of security. Simplicity is absolutely essential.
",1,1,prediction_comments_signalandroid.csv
50633,"@donjoe0 well but that's a big usability issue. You can't make the user read a ton of stuff before getting started. **There must not be an extensive setup routine**, otherwise nobody will use the app. Users get confused really easily, and you can hardly do any worse than confuse somebody before they've even started using the app.

Also, somebody concerned about prosecution for their opinions should not use SMS in the first place (network operator knows the recipient). Push is way better in that regard. So the argument for the smokescreen texts is maybe not the best. Additionaly, if you do stuff that's obviously designed to hide your tracks and leave false trails, that is rather likely to make whoever is after you have a closer look at you. Having settings like that is just a shit idea, as long as not everyone's install does that. And good luck telling the average western user that this app will send 100 texts a day to random people around the world because that may make some dude in some country more safe. To summarise: the idea isn't thought through. You could do that kind of stuff over push though, because nobody cares about an extra 2KB a day, and you don't even need a setting for it (just enable it for everyone).

The big problem is you're choosing as primary targets two very different demographics: the casual ""first-world"" texter who doesn't know anything about security and doesn't even want to know and the revolutionary ""second-world"" or ""third-world"" texter who doesn't know anything about security but needs to use as much of it as possible and needs to find out about it from this app's interface.

When you put it that way it does indeed appear that there's no better option than simply asking the user right at the start if they plan to use the app in a threatening environment where they might be in physical danger if anyone unauthorized manages to read their messages or if they just want a convenient way to exchange text messages with members of their social environment. All this will lead to are the two most extreme security profiles, i.e. extremely high security or extremely low security. Anyone who wants anything between these extremes will have to go fiddle with the stuff in the Settings menu and unless they happen to be a nerd, we have to accept that they might not understand what they're selecting and that they might make the app unnecessarily cumbersome to use because we didn't want to help them understand threat models by including a well-designed wizard for this. (Keep in mind that even the revolutionary user will eventually get to the Settings menu and they still might try to flip some switches in there just to see what happens or just to get rid of some usage impediment. Are you sure you want them to not have a chance to understand what they're doing at least at the level at which a decent threat model wizard could explain it?)

It doesn't even have to be a startup wizard - you can keep just the ""revolution vs. casual texing"" question at the startup and put the threat model wizard right in the Settings menu - so the Security section of the Settings menu wouldn't just show you all the detailed options directly but ask you first if you know what you're doing or if you want to go through a wizard that might make things clearer for you.

50643,"> The big problem is you're choosing as primary targets two very different demographics

I chose them because they are the important ones. And the second demographic mostly uses what the first decided on. There's a reason some of the Middle-Eastern revolutions are called ""Facebook revolution"". Were there better tools? Absolutely. But they used what everybody already had, because it doesn't matter if you are the safest activist in the world, if you don't have others to talk to securely.

> the revolutionary ""second-world"" or ""third-world"" texter who doesn't know anything about security but needs to use as much of it as possible

I agree

> but needs to use as much of it as possible and needs to find out about it from this app's interface.

This would be nice, really. But it will not happen. Ever. I have talked on end with critical journalists in South America. They were really pissed when I put a password on their wifi and made their mail clients use https.
Those are the kind of people in danger, and they get annoyed by once entering a damn password into their computer. The amount of ignorance and absence of the most basic knowledge of the workings of computers and IT systems really is staggering.

I am targeting those two demographics because of the people in need actually use what is widely available, not what is actually best for their usecase. And the more average chatty teenagers (not just western) use this, the better the deniability and protection for those in actual need.

If there are 500 users with TS installed in an undemocratic country, the authorities can just do an easy network analysis (at least for the SMS verification and encrypted SMS messages) and then kick in every door with a 99% chance of getting an ""enemy of the state"".

If there are 500000 users, with maybe 5000 activists, there are simply too many doors to kick in. And it's easier to hide 500 kicked in doors from the public than it is to hide a few thousand ones.

So we are going to have to be ready with a joint campaign for Whisper - the combination of TS and RedPhone, with a really well made video and a slimlined, informative website as well as a TS that's really tweaked for usability.
If that's done I'm sure the campaign will have a lot of success, considering how far the development has already come, where it's going (federation, GCM free alternative...) and who started the whole shebang.

1. More platforms sure wouldn't hurt. The iOS and Android devs are really busy, maybe we could pay someone to get off the ground with **Windows Phone**. Not sure if we should try to make RedPhone work there too. I think texting has priority.
2. Then there is of course the **desktop client**.
I mean a browser plugin is certainly better than nothing, but plugins for pidgin/miranda/kopete would be a real killer feature I don't think any of the competitors has.
The added compatibility an open protocol brings with it can really come into play here.
If the campaign gets enough publicity, we may even find some people interested to work on that in their own time.
3. **Making RedPhone work seamlessly** in all kinds of network settings. I for one have a lot of problems with calls beeing dropped after a while, ""server error"" messages before the call can even start (probably because my router connects via VPN to my provider...UDP over TCP sucks) and lots of other ""funny"" behaviour. I haven't really bothered logging and reporting all of that but I'm rather positive RedPhone could use some serious work on that end.
4. And the **RedPhone for iOS** part, which isn't ready yet and seems to be quiet some time away from completion.
5. Pay our server and texting **bills** ;-)
6. Our **own distribution channel** out of Play and the GCM free **websockets support** for the client, as nobody is really working on that atm. Also according to moxie websockets have some serious drawbacks for battery usage. Mayyybe we could set up the first **FOSS push network**? I'm sure there are a hell of a lot FOSS Apps that would like to use that too.
7. People seem to dig ""self-destructing messages"". I'm not sure if it can even be cryptographically implemented. I guess the apps that implement this work kinda like that: 
Server: ""Server here, please delete this message now. And don't you forget the burning message animation!""
Client: ""Sir yes sir, right away sir!""
Modified client: ""Who are you?""

50942,"With a friend of mine happened exactly the same thing than with @haagar and @tinloaf.

In his contact list (localized at his mobile, not synchronized with Google Contacts etc.) my number was in format 87654321 (eight numbers). In some places in Brazil, was added a ninth digit, so my correct number became 987654321. In the moment my friend installed TextSecure (it was yesterday), my number was wrong (87654321). We were together in person, so I could check and perform tests by myself in his mobile. Made lots of experiments: change number, delete number, delete contact, create contact, duplicate contact with derivated numbers.

My deduction is that some parts of TextSecure updates correctly the number, so that in the main contact list I appeared with the new entry: ""Leandro Salvador +5511987654321""... +55 = Brazil, 11 = area code, 987654321 = my mobile number. But, clicking over my contact to send me a message, in the message window, it appears: ""Leandro Salvador 87654321"". Freak, don't?

Testing, I created four ""clones"":
LS1: +5511987654321 <-- perfect E164 format
LS2: 987654321 <-- correct number which TS can handle correctly
LS3: 87654321 <-- old number, means nothing now, but TS insists on keeping it
LS4: 7654321 <-- completelly freak number, but TS deduces (incorrectly) that is my

All these four different contacts are the same contact for TextSecure, when sending a message: the same message window opens.

So, when I send him a message from my TextSecure, it arrives via SMS only, not encrypted, although, strangely, the lock appears closed for both of us. The DATA channel doesn't work in any sense. I can send SMS to him. He can not send me neither SMS or DATA: my number, after all, is not 87654321, but 987654321. When I send him a message, despite of it all, from my correct 987654321 (or +5511987654321, as you wish), the message appears correctly as having been sent by me in his TextSecure main window (the one with multiple contacts showing up). But he can not answer me, because within the message window (the one with multiple messages between he and me), my number remains incorrect.

Tryed to create a group with four TS users. Just me with this problematic number in the contact list of my friend. Everything works fine in the group, except, guess!: the messages from he to me doesn't works. From me to he, goes ok. From everybody to everybody, ok.

If prints could help, please let me know.

My bet is that there is some algorithm that reads and/or record the phone number from right to left. So, adding numbers on the left side of the existing number, creates some confusion in TextSecure that does not correctly update the contact number.

51232,"OK, so I finally got off my ass and did some work on this. I got rid of the id passing to the adapter in favor of just toggling an ""animate the new row"" field before the message is sent so this should now work in both types of conversations.

Unfortunately animating the row height itself smoothly is beyond me. I tried all sorts of things and the closest I got was passing the list view itself to the adapter (ew) and hammering `smoothScrollToPosition` on every animation step to make sure it would stay on the row being animated. That wasn't very smooth and also had some strange issues like the list position going whack after opening the keyboard.

However, I found that setting a delay on the animation startup makes it somewhat less jarring. That way the empty space will first appear and the animation will come in a little later, instead of both things happening at once. It's not perfect but it's the best I can come up with.

Since the amount of ""bounce"" in the `OvershootInterpolator` can be configured, I tried setting a subtler value on that too. I came up with videos featuring new versions of both animations.

I am all for PUSH as the preferred transport. There are some legitimate usecases for SMS, but there is a reason why [WhatsApp alone sends more messages a day than all SMS are sent by all carrieres worldwide](http://www.tweaktown.com/news/34968/whatsapp-sees-50-billion-messages-per-day-more-than-all-sms-combined/index.html).
Those are just the most important ones:
- They aren't free in many parts of the world, e.g. Europe, Asia and South America.
- They can't transfer images, videos or arbitrary files (MMS are humongously expensive)
- They suck for group chats (MMS costs apply again)
- They leak metadata to the carriers (see #838 )

Because SMS are sometimes preferable over push messages, I opened #919.
If someone has free SMS and doesn't want to use the data channel for whatever reason he can turn it off.

If the improvements to the data channel to remedy the ""receiver offline"" case discussed here are implemented, I see absolutely no reason to show SMS as an equal choice to push.

I have never ever heard from anybody who wanted to always choose the transport for each message with both options there. And even then, #919 solves this with one long click on the send symbol.

I understant that in your cases, makes sense to prefer send messages via data channel than via SMS channel and, consequently, you would choose to prioritize DATA than SMS in architectural choices about the TextSecure course. However, this is not the same case everywhere in the world. In Brazil, for example, it is most common to find free SMS packages available, than hiring data plans.

My consideration just want to put on the table that what is a reality for some persons is not necessarily a reality for all people around the world. I personally, prefer to use DATA channel than SMS, but 98% of my contacts in Brazil don't use TextSecure, 70% not use even WhatsApp, but everybody uses SMS as a reliable mechanism for instant communication.

It is because I ask all of you that not degrade the SMS over the DATA channel. In Brazil an SMS costs around USD 0.02, to give you an idea, and 3G really sucks yet, besides costing super expensive.

I believe that in Brazil will be easier to bring users to the TextSecure as an excellent SMS client that allow encrypted SMS, than as a substitute for WhatsApp for now, and I'm an advocate in favor of using the TextSecure in my circles.

An ordinary postpaid combo of voice + data + SMS in Brazil (for example, Vivo operator), costs about BRA 115 (USD 50), which offers: 60 minutes to others operators + 1GB over 3G + **unlimited SMS** (to any operator). Check yourselves if you want, ok? =) http://goo.gl/La1gzq

An ordinary prepaid combo, on the other hand, costs about BRA 28 (USD 12), which offers: zero minutes to others operators + 300MB over 3G + **unlimited SMS** (or BRA 0,05 = USD 0,02 to other operators). It's available to be checked at http://vivotudo.com.br/ ok? :)

As pointed out: Not everyone is used to send MMS, there are different reasons for that, but that's the reality. Because of cost issue most people probably switched from SMS directly to any other messaging app that uses IP (so not TextSecure), but still use SMS for all their non-smartphone buddies and so on. And as pointed out in #347 TextSecure fails in not-so-obvious ways for the non-tech-savy user that has no idea of SMS vs. MMS if you wanto to send a message to multiple people. So they will simply say: This App is bullshit and I'm going to delete it, because I'm only communicating with 10% of my SMS buddies over a secured channel.

Although, I understand your focus on more interesting things: As it used to work in previous versions it is now very hard to explain to users why they should fiddle with their MMS settings (seriously no-one understand these settings) or cannot use it anymore for group messaging. Especially beacause it used for them quite well in the past and they already got used to it.

While it might be that other apps are converging as well, the reality looks different. And this means that all of these apps are just disconnecting from reality - read their users.

Police of the most stupid regime may be unaware of the feature at most until they interrogate one of the users.

Then this feature is not critical for push messages at all, as Google's servers are considered trusted as long as the only official build is distributed trough their Play store ( #127 ). Data traffic  metadata retention is not that detailed to allow such analysis.

The only issue I had until recently was with my phone not sending/receiving MMS but I came across a way to fix it on XDA-DEV  courtesy of 'wesgarner':

""
                    FYI - found a fix. If anyone is having issues sending/receiving MMS, do this:
                    
(load up adb shell)
                    
su
                    
mount -o rw,remount /system
                    
rm /system/bin/ip
                    
ln -s /system/xbin/ip /system/bin/ip
""

MMS does NOW work..

As for push messages, not sure why the chase bank ones never come 
through... (chase check deposit app sucks too.. hardly works)... Is your problem with chase as well?

symmetric encryption. The way textsecure encrypts SMS on the phone as they
are received is great. The full disk encryption in ICS is a bit of a joke
because of the weak passphrases, not to mention other apps reading the
messages.

Anyway, I'll let you know how it goes.

Also there are some strings in places like ReceiveKeyActivity which were broken up originally just for formatting, and should probably just be special cased into a single big @string with a descriptive name.

1237,"In a couple of cases, you have identified specific examples of wider rules. Expanding ""don't"" to ""do not"" and ""it's to ""it is"" are instances of the broader rule to not use contractions. That is, an apostrophe should always indicate a possessive. (That one comes from formal academic writing, which has had a large influence on technical writing over the years.)

""e.g."" to ""for example"" and ""i.e."" to ""that is"" and ""via"" to ""through"" are all examples of avoiding Latin. More than half the population confuse ""e.g."" and ""i.e."". Similarly, most people couldn't tell you what ""via"" actually means. (It's Latin for ""through."" I studied Latin in college.) Also, screen readers sometimes do awful things to them, most notably rendering ""e.g."" as ""egg.""

""Will enable"" is an instance of the broader rule to never use ""will"" or otherwise use the future tense. The better reason to do that is consistency. Keeping everything in the simple present tense is more consistent. Doing so often makes sentences shorter, too. The worse reason is one of those funny-sad stories. When I worked at GE, we got sued because we had used ""will"" in a document. Some twit sued us because we made a promise we didn't keep. The case got tossed out, but GE had to pay lawyers to deal with it.

Aside from consistency, all three of these editing rules have another reason behind them, too: English as a second language. Consistency is itself a huge help to people who may not have a strong grasp of English and have to read things multiple times to get the meaning. Avoiding Latin (and other languages that aren't English) keeps yet another language out of the mix. Expanding contractions avoids potential misreadings. Keeping the tense in the simple present avoids parsing of more than one tense. 

Finally, many cultures expect a greater level of formality than native English speakers expect. If our audience were solely native English speakers, we could be a lot more ""loose"" in our writing. However, the Chinese (especially) and other asian cultures expect formal structures in their technical writing. To them, it is official writing, and they believe it should be written that way. They are more comfortable with more formal writing, and we should meet them where they are, so long as doing so does not cause other troubles (and all these other rules have other good reasons behind them, too).",1,1,prediction_comments_springboot.csv

Irrespective of how the auto-configuration is packaged, having unneeded dependencies on the classpath will cause things to be auto-configured that you do not need. If you want to use jOOQ with R2DBC and don't want Spring Data's R2DBC repositories, Spring Framework's transaction management, etc, depending on only jOOQ and R2DBC will get you much closer without having to exclude anything.

The changes you've made look good to me. My only hesitation is with `AnnotationConfigReactiveWebApplicationContext` since it's a breaking change. We have the same problem as Juergen there. Ideally we'd leave it alone and create a new version, but we really really want to use the existing name. I toyed with `AnnotationConfigGenericReactiveWebApplicationContext`, but it just sucks!

Since that context is just for reactive code, and since we've probably not got many users working with it directly, I think we should just risk changing the base class. I do think we should perhaps re-introduce deprecated versions of methods from the old class (I've done that on my branch). We can't make them work, but at least we can give people hints that they're deprecated. We should also add additional constructors I think.

Overall, I'm +1 for the changes.

I couldn't raise an issue in spring-data-commons, so I figured I'd have to raise it here. The issue (if it was an issue) would belong to spring-framework issues then?

Thank you for the link, but that seems like something different. The third argument is content.size(), which is for totalElements.
The behavior I'm seeing comes from this:
PageImpl<T> extends Chunk<T>
which defines getSize() and it returns pageable.getPageSize().
So the [Page<T>.getSize() returns pageable.getPageSize().](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-commons/blob/cb37bdd99427c6c3b924d84568706cbeb3fe25e7/src/main/java/org/springframework/data/domain/Chunk.java#L73)

This feels so weird...

This is then propagated to the resulting API response, which has both size, numberOfElements and totalElements. But what feels weirder is that I have to compare page.numberOfElements vs list.size. 

Page.size returning some arbitary number instead of the real page size is unexpected and surprising at least.

* A dedicated tool released by Spring Security - sucks because there's one more brew/install dance for the user
* A CLI extension - doesn't suck too bad, but Spring Security need to release another JAR and the user needs to do `$ spring install org.springframework.security:spring-security-cli:1.2.3.RELEASE`

For extensibility it may actually be better for `type` to be a list. This would remove the need for `ALL` and the default would be `BLOCKING, REACTIVE`. It would be an error to mix `NONE` with either `BLOCKING` or `REACTIVE`.

unfortunately I get the same issue when upgrading from SpringBoot 1.4.1.RELEASE to 1.5.9.RELEASE, even though i have referred to a real `@Configuration` class :-)

[Your Workaround works](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/10465#issuecomment-336397898), but it is ugly and contradicts the [documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-testing.html#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-jpa-test).

I've added a [pull request](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-issues/pull/73) to spring-boot-issues that reproduces this problem and ask to reopened the issue to get notified, when it is fixed or at least documented.

I think we definitely need to avoid a configuration that will lead to Tomcat logging an error (or warning) at startup.

We consider this issue very serious. As soon as I get the necessary review from other team members, I intend to release 1.5.4 with a fix. I hope to do that this week still.

You can workaround that particular issue in the meantime by registering a second `Validator`. If there are more than one `Validator` bean in the context, then you'll bypass the faulty condition. For instance, adding this to your app:

```java
@Component
public class DummyValidator implements Validator {

	@Override
	public boolean supports(Class<?> clazz) {
		return false;
	}

	@Override
	public void validate(Object target, Errors errors) {

	}
}
```

Another option is to not register your `DemoValidator` as a @Bean but that's more involved that this simple (stupid) hack.

By the way, apologizes for the side note. Your `README` was perfectly clear, I just completely missed it 😢

53336,"In Elasticsearch 5 they have [dropped official support for running embedded Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-the-server). They do, however, provide [EsIntegTestCase](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/integration-tests.html). Unfortunately, it's _very_ picky about what's on the classpath and tests fail to launch if it finds any duplicate classes. For example it pulls in `org.elasticsearc:securemock` which contains lots of Mockito classes. This then prevents the use of Mockito itself within the same project. Even with lots of exclusions in place to tune the classpath, it still couldn't run a unit test in Eclipse as the check found a duplicate internal Eclipse class.

The alternative is to roll our own code to bootstrap an Elasticsearch node as part of `@DataElasticsearchTest` that skips the jar hell check. That would probably be sufficient for integration testing purposes.

I've figured out, that there are two methods in `org.springframework.boot.context.embedded.tomcat.TomcatEmbeddedServletContainerFactory` that are trying to create a temp directory - `getEmbeddedServletContainer` and `prepareContext`. Setting `server.tomcat.basedir` only helps for `getEmbeddedServletContainer`. For the `prepareContext` I had to create a new directory `static` within the working directory of my docker container. This is because of `AbstractEmbeddedServletContainerFactory.getValidDocumentRoot`.

Maven dependencies can go seriously screwy when a driver version is required that is different from the OGM version packaged with the Spring Boot starter for Neo4j. In these situations, it is not sufficient to simply use the new driver. You must also include all the other OGM dependencies as well.

The current version on the master branch of sdn4-university supports spring-boot packaged jar and wars. You do not need to specify additional classpath entries such as BOOT-INF/classes. The driver selection mechanism also works correctly, correcting the bug that was introduced in 2.0.5. The README contains additional instructions for creating a packaged jar/war.

If the unit's dependencies are interfaces, no problem, they mock fine. But if classes, the mocking does not work completely and requires the dependencies of the dependency to be wired in.

The ""workaround"" for this is to provide `@MockBean`s for dependencies of the dependency, and dependencies of the dependency's dependencies and so on down, which is pretty ugly. Another is to only use interfaces for your dependencies - which I prefer - but you don't always have that luxury when the dependency is not in your control. Of course, I could wrap it in my own interface but that's extra code that I wouldn't need if `@MockBean` behaved like Mockito class mocking from the standpoint of not needing to provide dependencies to the mock.

The classes in question are in maven projects that are in the same eclipse workspace, so they end up in the classpath as fully qualified folders. (UGH!) 

This is what my lauch configuration looks like (I have removed the JVM args and a majority of my classpath for brevity):

```
C:\opt\jdk1.8.0\bin\javaw.exe ... -classpath C:\devel_eureka\build-parent\build-web\build-webservices\target\classes;C:\devel_eureka\build-parent\build-services\target\classes;C:\devel_eureka\build-parent\build-core\build-domain\target\classes;...
```

I added the file ""META-INF/spring-devtools.properties"" and I just brute-forced the expressions : 

```
restart.include.buildservices=C:\\devel_eureka\\build-parent\\build-services\\target\\classes
restart.include.builddomain=C:\\devel_eureka\\build-parent\\build-core\\build-domain\\target\\classes
```

This type of pattern will be problematic for us because it : requires the fully qualified path and we have developers both on Windows and Macs (so the pattern will be different depending on OS)

The class `com.build.service.category.CategoryServiceImpl` is in the `build-service` module and the
message being marshalled from Rabbit into my handler is in the `build-domain`.

I am still running into the same issue and I am wondering if its because the message object is being marshalled from a string into a Java object via a Jackson message converter?

Also, everything that uses `@PersistenceContext` and thus Spring's `PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor` is basically screwed, too as this will cause the blocking call to `EMF.createEntityManager(…)` via `SharedEntityManagerCreator`.

In Gunnar's case we just switched off the groovy resolver `spring.groovy.template.enabled=false` and it was fine.

It's a nasty gotcha for people that accidentally include groovy-templates on the classpath and aren't using it. The most common reason for that is including groovy-all (which shouldn't exist IMO, and definitely shouldn't be included as a non-optional dependency in anything else, which is how it usually gets on the classpath).

Currently the `repackage` task does not offer any direct customizations for the kind of thing that you are looking to do. There is no way to `exclude` specific nested jars. Applying `exclude()` on the `jar` task won't help because repacking occurs after the original jar (that doesn't yet contain nested jars) has been created.

The good news is that Gradle is quite flexible so I think that you can achieve the result that you want by defining a custom `configuration`. You could for example declare a `provided` configuration like this:

```
configurations {
    provided
}
```

Then declare dependencies on `c` and `d` using that configuration:

```
dependencies {
    provided(project("":c""))
    provided(project("":d""))
    // ...
}
```

You'll also need to add that configuration to your main source set:

```
sourceSets.main.compileClasspath += configurations.provided

The `repackage` task only adds jars from the `compile` and `runtime` configurations so dependencies in your new `provided` configuration won't appear as nested jars (you obviously still need to somehow get the classes from `c.jar` and `d.jar` into `b.jar`).

I've created a [sample project](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-issues/tree/master/gh-1310) that you can take a look at and some more information about the general configuration technique can be found [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10405970/how-do-i-define-a-compile-time-only-classpath-in-gradle).

I'm not sure how this introduces a security risk - it lets the Servlet 3 container handle uploads when the coder wants it to (e.g., when we define an endpoint that accepts a MultipartFile.) I don't think it opens up an endpoint, per se? What's the attack vector that I'm missing?  

Boot ""turns on"" a lot of things in the hopes of being helpful generally with toggles to turn it off later if the situation calls for it. I didn't think turning this bean on would hurt, especially since I can think of no other use case where you'd want it except for file uploads and - as it was - you don't get that functionality out of the box.  

Me, I think both beans should be ""on"" by default and they can exclude the whole darned AutoConfig if ever the need arises (like security). I'd be happy to remove the property, or worse case, default it to false. I'm not sure how else to default this bean to false without the property, though.

- In the case of a multi-modules project, not specifying the version allows for a centralized management of your dependencies. No dependencies mismatch. No dependencies update hell.

I am torn on 2, as, AFAIR, handling collections inspects the collection's element type for `ObjectMapper` selection. Thus, from a consistency point of view, I guess I'd expect the additional `Mono` wrapping not to result in different serialization behavior compared to without the `Mono` wrapping. That said, the devil is in the details, here, too. Accepting `*/*` makes this work as it can adapt to the media type for calculated for `List` (likely `application/json`). If the media type to be produced was calculated from the element type, we'd end up with `application/hal+json` but then end up rendering a simple JSON array, which is not valid HAL (also discussed in detail [here](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-hateoas/issues/1584#issuecomment-880796201)).

The gist of spring-projects/spring-framework#27074's take on 3 is that I think looking up an `ObjectMapper` for `EntityModel` and `application/x-ndjson` is wrong, as the processing is already implementing the media type and looking up `ObjectMapper` instances for *the elements* of the stream. The NDJSON spec requires them to be of plain JSON, which means that a lookup should rather use `application/json` as media type to produce. Spring HATEOAS current setup would then cause that to be answered with the `ObjectMapper` registered for the first listed media type in `@EnableHypermediaSupport`, for which in a standard Spring Boot arrangement HAL is the actual format produced. I.e. the client would see a stream of HAL rendered `EntityModel` documents.

This sucks because if you don't specify a preference (no ""accept"" header) Spring happily renders the string and sends a 200. The  problem then is that it is a JSON string, so it gets quoted, which is daft from a UX point of view. Is there really no way to detect the runtime type? Jackson can do it, apparently, if the JSON case works.

I'll try multiple controller methods as well. But that's kind of mad, and it's a workaround IMO. I potentially have to add a new method to the controller for every single media type.

Thanks for making progress on this. I will add additional comment

An `@Autowired` dependency targeting an asynchronous bean **could**, in my mind, be set immediately as a proxy to the asynchronous bean. If enough threads start in parallel to initialize beans, any reference to a bean that is asynchronous and injected could result in a call to Future.get(timeout) by the lazy proxy.

This introduced all kinds of hell for bean deadlocking, but is a very simple approach and can be configured by means of parallelism and timeout to address the deadlocking issues.

After all, Spring already detects circular dependencies, and timeouts are widely used in detecting a deadlock.

I'd argue that `TypeReference` is more of an internal implementation detail that normal users need not be bothered with.

There may be some particular use cases where normal users need to work with `TypeReference`, but for the most common use cases users will be happier with supplying a `Class` or `String`. Furthermore, supporting `String` will remove lots of superfluous `TypeReference.of(<string>)` occurrences within user code.

Playing devil's advocate... we don't require users to supply a `TypeReference` for a `Class`, so why should we require them to supply a `TypeReference` for a  `String`?

As a concrete example, this issue was a requirement for #28745 to improve the developer experience. The newly introduced `AopProxyUtils.completeJdkProxyInterfaces(*)` methods could of course be refactored to return `TypeReference[]` instead of `Class<?>[]` and `String[]`, but that seemed unnatural and unnecessary.

Hey Juergen Hoellar,

I totally agree with you completely. But they are service layer dtos, so it will be ok for them to have imports from

web layer. If required we can take out interface from them and use interface for them in bottom layer. So this will

solve the problem of web imports in bottom layer. At end collecting all request param in one bean will be good way

to handle them at once. Imagine i need two query params, two headers and two path params, it will require six parametes

for them in controller method apart from other parametres like request body, http request, http response, locale and

security principal. They together with all these other parameter create long list of parameter, this make controller method

look ugly and inelegant.

Hi [Stefan Pfeiffer](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=spfeiffer) - sorry about the super late response.

Request matching in Spring MVC is handled by `AntPathMatcher`, which is a complex beast.
It is used to match request paths against patterns and order matching patterns from most specific to least specific.

As of #11407, #13325 and others, we've tried to streamline a bit its behavior with the following rules:
* the more ""matching"" parts a pattern has, the least specific it is
* if two patterns are equally specific, the longer one is considered the most specific
* `""/**""` patterns are less specific than all others

This description explains the behavior you're describing. I'm sorry this isn't the expected one in your case.

Note that you can remove ambiguity here by adding a regexp part to the `""{var1}""` path segment.

Hi again, it seems `@Configurable` does not work for me for this specific problem (at least not with compile-time weaving), though it is not clear to me why not.
Just getting the combination of maven, spring and aspectj to work is a challenge in itself, but once I had this working, my `@Configurable` annotation still had no effect for the hibernate jpa EntityListener.

The closest I found to an explanation is this:
http://www.simonellistonball.com/technology/injecting-dependencies-into-a-jpa-entitylistener/

A common workaround suggested on StackOverflow seems to be to use a Helper class storing the ApplicationContext in a static member:
https://guylabs.ch/2014/02/22/autowiring-pring-beans-in-hibernate-jpa-entity-listeners/
But this is very ugly and causes separate Spring Tests Contexts to interact when one context is supposed to have mocked EntityListeners and another one should use the real class (In my legacy codebase this is the case, as a workaround I do something like this: autowireCapableBeanFactory.autowireBean(helperClass) in the setup of each test).

One somewhat cleaner solution is to manually register Spring beans as hibernate event listeners:
https://deepintojee.wordpress.com/2012/02/05/spring-managed-event-listeners-with-jpa/
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10602342/how-do-i-set-up-an-event-listener-on-a-hibernate-4-entity
But this looks quite ugly, verbose, and i don't even see how this can be restricted to specific entities, other than doing bad instanceof checks within the BeanEventListener.

This is all really painful, and it would be great if some future Spring version worked better together with JPA EntityListeners without requiring AOP, unless I missed something obvious. I can try to reproduce the problem of why with my java, spring, maven and jpa versions `@Configurable` will not work with APO, but that will take time.

The actual end result depends on the client, but in our case the request was rejected because the content type changed from JSON to XML.
I think the issue at hand is related but not exactly the same as #17831. The order of converters, as you mentioned, has changed and is a problem. What also has changed is that instead of registering all converters if they're present on the class path, the code was changed to add only one that's found first (`if` vs `if-else`).
I'm not sure why the framework imposes a preference for any kind of converter based on the class path. It seems like a bad idea. In a large project, there may be more than one libraries on the class path and keeping the order straight like the way Spring wants it is a fragile and ugly process. Why not have the options to let the developer choose an implementation, like `preferJackson` or `preferJAXB`. If they don't specify, default to the previous behavior. I also don't see the value in the change made to register converters exclusively instead of all (`if-else`). The converters are tried in order and it seems perfectly reasonable to have multiple that can handle same content and the first one wins. That's the whole point of having a chain of converters.
I love Spring but the changes made to `AllEncompassingFormHttpMessageConverter` in 4.2.0.RELEASE don't seem to be well thought out.

`@Service`(""TestService2"")

That was a typo in my test project that I missed :)  In my actual project it is `@Service`(""testService2"").  Now I usually put the `@Service` annotation on the impl class and specify the name to be the interface (first letter lower case, which I screwed up on this test project).  I do this because in the past not doing this created errors that no matching beans were found during autowiring.  I will try not specifying it and see if I get that error any longer.

Anyway it all makes sense.  It sounds like passing the unwrapped object to verify as well in addition to adding `@Primary` on my actual project should fix all issues.

Thanks again for the explanation.

We are using Spring as a complete stack. Since the beginning of Spring 3.x we have moved our code base almost completely to Spring. We migrated to our legacy architecture based on Tuckey Filters etc... to Spring as well.

Let me to summarize our use cases:

NotFound:

+ Some browser malware extensions are requesting some unknown urls [ 1 ] to our application. You can imagine how ugly and annoying looks these stupid urls at our logs.
+ Some browsers are sending illegal favicon requests despite of specifying clearly its location. Also users who bookmarked our site can request at wrong favicon url.

Implementing a new url is easy but repeating these steps is annoying and polluting code base.

Redirections:

+ This is very important in terms of SEO. SEO guides clearly states that never remove a indexed page. Instead of removing, redirect them to correct one.

Forbidden pages:

+ This is not actually very much used for us but I thought that It can be complementary to other common http statuses. We are heavily using redirections to not having a SEO penalty.

How about a parameter to spring:url, or the individual spring:param to control the encoding that is applied during substitution?

I'm surprised people would want to expand the variable as a path hierarchy (preserving the /), rather than as PathVariable (and thus encoding the /).  Is that really going to be common compared to using it as a PathVariable?

In the meantime i will have to encode the variable myself before passing to spring:url.  Nasty and makes traditional URL parameters much more attractive than PathVariables.  I.e. /circuit/view?id=my%2FAId

> Can anyone clarify the way this should work?

As you discovered, this does _not_ currently work.

> But how do I make this work?

As an ugly work-around, you could reference different, empty `@Configuration` classes for each level in the context hierarchy in the configuration declaration in the subclass. This would _trick_ the framework into thinking that the local configuration is unique, thus avoiding the exception. Of course, this is less than ideal.

> Also, I don't like the idea of repeating the initializer for each `@ContextConfiguration`. If there is a better way, I would appreciate any suggestions.

Initializers can currently only be declared per `@ContextConfiguration` annotation. Thus there is no way to avoid repeating the declaration of the initializer at this time. However, we could consider adding an `initializers` attribute to `@ContextHierarchy` in a future release. If you feel that this would be a good feature to have, please open a separate JIRA issue to request that.

Indeed I made a commit into (say) `/gradlew` and that screwed up everything? I always create branches for changes, and changes in branches do not touch files which I changed before creating a branch.

_adds unnecessary noise to the commit history_

To history – yes, to shown diff – no. The diff is clean (in a way that that it shows exactly what I've changed in branch, that includes all comments/notes you've made in all pulls). I think github could be improved in showing the history list – that is really weird. Noise that I create – that my fault and my disease to keep everything perfect. My apologies for that.

_you'll always what's called a Fast Forward, i.e. there is no need for a 3 way merge._

I hope that really works :) My last [pull#334](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-framework/pull/334) was really a 1-commit fix into the branch after series of merges with origin. However github still shows all merges since mesozoic era. I can't explain that.

_There is no need to do ""pull to origin"" if you don't make changes in master._

In my story `origin` = `https://github.com/dmak/spring-framework` and `upstream` = `https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-framework`.

I can't commit changes to branch without committing the results of merge. Logical?

What ideally I want to achieve:
- I would love to divert from upstream in my origin. That may touch configuration files, maybe dependencies. I want these changes to be propagated to branches I create after.
- Branches themselves are clean: they change only the files I intend to change and they don't collide with changes I made in previous change.

This is a pretty important issue to address from a user experience perspective.

As one example, if you forget `@Configuration` on a `@Transactional` test, transaction rollbacks will just not work even though the logging indicates otherwise. It's not obvious at all that the cause of a transaction not being rolled back is related to forgetting a `@Configuration` annotation on a config class.

Hi Keith,

I'm not trying to put the onus on you per se; I'm just trying to ensure that the code works _as expected_. I believe that the tests I checked in demonstrate the expected behavior, but that of course may not cover enough use cases. That's why I'd like to see a failing use case so that I can assess if it's just a configuration error (perhaps due to a misunderstanding and/or misleading documentation) or rather a true bug in the framework.

We certainly want to do the best we can to support the user experience, but enforcing that `@Configuration` is present is not an option since it is perfectly viable to declare _annotation classes_ that are not `@Configuration` classes. So that is not an error. Perhaps we could warn the user (via a log statement), but I fear that the warning would be annoying to those who intentionally declared other types of annotated classes.

I attached everything I found relevant for you. If you look at the call stack, most of the getMethod calls are from the Spring batch listeners registration process (registerStepListeners and registerItemListeners respectively).

Eventually, both end up in `org.springframework.batch.support.getMethodInvokerByAnnotation(final Class<? extends Annotation> annotationType,                                                             final Object target)`.

I have attached every call to this method in the attached excel file (ugh!). The first column is the class name of the object (or proxy around it) and the second column is the required annotation type. You'll see by yourself but it seems it is called four times for the same annotation and the same target (actually 2 times for the step listener registration and 2 times for the item listener registration).

I don't know if we can avoid this duplication (Dave might definitely have more insight) but the difference between 2.5 and 3.0 is obvious and is located in Spring core. I have attached the call stack of the same registration process with Spring 2.5 for you to compare.

Hi Andrew,

I'm the original reporter of this bug. As far as I remember I could not found any way to inject an alternate comparator (or maybe I didn't want to...), but as you can see in the attached java file I could find a workaround. It's ugly but it worked for me. In your case it would consist in rewriting ""/user/**/{a}/{b}"" to become ""/user/**/**/{a}/{b}"". As ""**"" and ""**/**"" evaluates in the same way, it does not change the meaning of your mapping, but it does increase the number of stars thus making this mapping less likely to be used .

I looked at the Jackson annotations, and while some of them are going to be helpful when I send my domain objects back (the ignore one mainly), this won't help me with my mapping problems whenever I get json from the server.

Arjen, how hard would it be for someone (me, you, whoever) to implement a `@Mapping` annotation alongside the `@RequestBody` annotation. Or maybe add a parameter that says, ""usePropertyEditors=true"".

If I use `@RequestBody`... and it's looking more and more that I am forced to due to the crappiness of the ajax library world... then I'm sure you can agree that doing the domain object mapping for arrays of arrays of arrays of ids is going to be a pain in the rear... no?

I refuse to code this manually for 100+ controllers. I absolutely refuse. This is just crap code to write.

The idea is that since Spring would do the marshalling (via Jackson, or whatever) as well as do the mapping via property editors, the application developer would only have to code the CategoryAnswerSubmission class in this case... nothing else!

Can you see how nice this would be if we had List of objects that also contained more lists and so on? If we don't have this feature, the developer is FORCED to do the mapping manually. And man, that sucks!!!!

Okay, Adding "".id"" to the path fixes the selected value problem within spring. But I really, really strongly don't think this is the right way to do it.

```
<@springForm.select path=""myobject.province.id"" items=provinces multiple=false
itemLabel=""name"" itemValue=""id"" />
```

This works just fine if the province is already set on userAccount object. However, what if the province object is null? Want to know what happens? Spring throws a ""myobject.province"" is null exception.

Of course it throws that... because I'm sure the bean wrapper is trying to call getId() on a null object.

So if I am forced to use ""myobject.province.id"" as the full path, then that means all my form backing objects must set these many-to-one objects to empty, transient objects. Man, this is a huge pain. So much bloat! Spring, we shouldn't have to do this.

Naturally, this causes problems. Imagine if somehow this gets trickled down to hibernate. Hibernate is going to want to save this province value, but it'll be transient and an id of 0 won't be valid. Hibernate isn't smart enough to take this empty province object with an id of 0 and a province name of null and make the entire province reference ""null"". It won't do it.

This means that I'm going to have to validate all of these many-to-one references now to make sure they aren't uninitialized transients. More bloat! This is a smell and a half.

Also, pointing the ""myobject.province.id"" is very bad. Setting the id of an existing object is very dangerous thing to do. For example, if the province ""Ontario"" has an id of 9 and we want to change it to ""Yukon"" which is id 13... behind the scenes Spring is setting Ontario's id to 13, and then the property editor eventually replaces the whole object with the Yukon object altogether ""a little later""

This is dangerous though for two reasons:

1) If the ""a little later"" doesn't happen, the local version of ""Ontario"" will have an id of 13, which is incorrect. It should be 9 and only 9 and never anything else. I think ""a little later"" will always happen, but I don't want to count on it. This is why we shouldn't make the path ""myobject.province.id"" and it should just be ""myobject.province""

2) A more dangerous scenario is the province's changes being cascaded by the underlying database, which causes more checks that the developers has to make = MORE BLOAT. Let's say we change Ontario's id to 13. If Hibernate should decide that we really want this change to be made in the database, it will save Ontario's id to 13, which will conflict with Yukon's id of 13, and thus will crash the system since it is violating a primary key constraint!

Guys, I love you and all, but this a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very bad problem.

This should be put to BLOCKER and fixed immediately so that the natural path ""myobject.province"" works.

Any chance on changing this from an ""Improvement"" to a ""Bug""? This breaks the form:textarea tag which forces you to revert to our friend spring:bind. Not the end of the world but it makes for ugly jsps - use the new form tags _EXCEPT_ for form:textarea since it is broken...

The ""readonly"" attribute is a standard html 4.0 attribute, thus its absence in the form tag library should make it a bug. Also, contrary to the submitter, readonly is supported in the form:input and form:password tags.

Better don´t use that attached patch ... weired things will happen.

I should have known that an implementation of a IMHO dubious and outdated specification (JavaBeans) will most likely be dubious, too!

PropertyDescriptor uses Soft- and/or Weak-References internally. That means that depending on the classloading/spring configuration setting, e.g., using a lot of lazy-init, the patch will only **temporarily** and **non-deterministically** affect the cached BeanInfo and secretly reinitialize to its original descriptors when the java.lang.reflect instances have been gc'ed.

That´s what I call transparent!

May I´d better file a bug request at java.sun.com to ditch that whole f**ing spec?

Well, this is the same general issue as with all session-scoped service objects then: If they contain references to shared service objects, those either have to marked as transient (losing those references on serialization) or not considered serializable in the first place (the entire object failing on serialization). This is not really JSF-specific; it's the same with any kind of session object in a Servlet environment.

However, a general solution is not apparent here. Spring has no way of interfering in the Servlet container's session persistence process: This means that the Servlet container will simply deserialize those instances and expose them in the reactivated session. We cannot perform dependency injection there, simply because the lifecycle of those objects is beyond Spring's control.

So I'm afraid there are only two options:
1. Rearchitect your session-scoped objects to only hold state (as dumb data holders), with your services just operating on them rather than service references residing in the session objects themselves.
2. Turn off any kind of session persistence, which you of course can only do if you're not actually relying on session persistence in the first place (many applications don't really need this).

Ok, something doesn't make sense here. The XML parser above should not be hitting the online version of the DTD, since there is an entity resolver in Spring that should resolve to the 2.0 version that is included in the Spring jar.

We absolutely could have another bean dtd definition (in a different place) for 2.0. It's always been my opinion that we should introduce a separate dtd version for each major upgrade, basically whenever we add new elements. In the past, Juergen (and others I believe) did not agree with me, so we generally for new versions, we overwrote the existing version online when the new version was finally out. This strategy has obvious problems. While Spring-based code has no issue (although something is breaking above) becasue of the entity resolver, anything that depends on the online definition (such as an XML editor in an IDE) is somewhat screwed. Anybody working in the new version while it's beta has no proper IDE XML support unless they register a local instane of the DTD for the XML editor in the IDE, while on the other hand, once the new version is released (let's say Spring 1.1 to Spring 1.2), anybody working with the older version of Spring will find that the XML editor in the IDE will be too permissive, as it will allow constructs from the new version, even when writing definitions meant fr the old one. Users will only find out about the problem when actually deploying the app.

So I think the strategy used so far (keep the exact same file) is not workable. I would suggest going to a separate DTD for each major version that introduces new elements. This includes 2.0.

If you search the forums you will see that a number of people have run into versions of this problem. The basic issue is that referenceData doesn't get called for the success view. I have run into this in a simple case where the success view is a relatively simple JSP, but one that does depend on some reference data. I suggest that referenceData be called and appended to the errors when rendering the success view.

This is not so much a problem if you override onSubmit, but it looks kludgy. It is a real pain if you override doSubmitAction. In that case you are screwed as there is no way to get to the model. This means that in several cases instead of overriding doSubmitAction I have had to override onSubmit and just to call referenceData. Really unfortunate.

If the point of referenceData is to set up the things that are common to most views, then one would expect that the reference data might be needed by the success view. This is marked as an improvement, but I consider it a bug.

It is unfortunate that this has slipped to 3.1.  I believe springs inability to address injection into serializable beans is a rather major shortcoming of Spring today.  This is compounded with the fact that this is not a problem for several competing frameworks.  Most notably:

Guice has its ""Provider"" injection pattern.
Seam uses interceptor based injection (which sucks but does avoid this problem)
WebBeans will use a scoped adapter/proxy concept

Spring Webflow itself adds a few new scopes that should be serializable.  Any scope that could serialize a bean currently cannot have anything injected into it (except possibly beans of the same scope).  That is a huge limitation IMHO.  I hope you can reconsider this functionality for Spring 3.0 as this is currently a major spring pain point for my organization.

That sounds like a great idea to me.  We usually use a factory for instantiating model objects for various reasons so i'd imagine that if we could register this against the bean wrapper we'd have a lot of smiling faces around the office.  I'm thinking aloud here so I could be talking rubbish but if it was smart enough to also deal with paths that include collections and add items to lists etc it would be a godsend.

Imagine I have a graph something like 'user.addresses[0].city' and I add a field to the form bound against 'user.addresses[1].city' but that doesn't exist in the model yet.  Currently we need to add pre binding to check for this kind of thing and put empty placeholders in so we have something to bind against.  If BeanWrapper could catch the null value in nested path exception, invoke the factory method registered for that path and populate the graph for binding things would be so much cleaner.

I second everyone on this thread -

this is an absolutely retarded issue that I also run into with SpringMVC from the get go. No self respecting, productive, and serious web framework these days requires developers to provide a preinstantiated nested object graph to populate on form submission (this is so 90's!). The work around with editors won't work in all situations and just adds to code clutter.

This problem has to be addressed.

In lieu of this fix,  overwriting the crap BeanWrapperImpl is really the only way to go for me if I were to stick with Spring Web.

- information missing; you lack the most important information; where on the client did it go wrong? In our case where an acceptance test does remote calls it will be hell to find the line where it went wrong. (can you imagine?)

Why can't you have the server exception as root exception of the client side exception? Just like ordinary RMI does. You will see both client as server side stacktrace. I think the attached zip demonstrates the stacktrace(s) as I think it should be displayed.

Matt,

I looked into this a little closer and there are a combination of things we can do.

We can add the mime.types file you specified to the Spring distribution which is probably a good start, but Juergen is right in that this will require a LOT of testing before we do this. Adding a mime.types file in a J2EE context may potentially screw up other applications that are relying on some specific behaviour since the JavaMail classes are likely to be loaded at server level and thus will have only one default mapping.

Alternatively, we can allow developers to configure a set of mime type mappings in their config files which Spring will use on a message-by-message basis and thus will not impact on anything that J2EE servers do to the overall JavaMail framework. Using this mechanism I can merge the defaults into the per-message context, so anyone who wants to use a mime.types file can and anyone who doesn't will simply get the default set supplied in JAF plus the ones they configure via Spring.

Although not quite as comprehensive out of the box, option two has less potential for cacking things up in a J2EE context, plus it keeps configuration inside Spring.

As a real compromise, I can create a FactoryBean that will read the a file in the format you have specified, or in Java properties format (a little nicer I think plus it won't be confused with the JAF file) and inject that into the per message context. This way you can reuse a file of mime types but you won't override any server level settings.

What are your thoughts?

Ideally, it would be great if you can provide a minimal, reproducible sample, if not, please try to share as much detail as possible.

This is odd, 405 means that the HTTP method is not supported. Can you also add the code of the controller that handles that method?",1,0,prediction_comments_springsecurity.csv
2268,"Hi @UglyHobbitFeet, since you did not share the logs where the 403 is happening, and based on what I could assume from your code, here are my thoughts:

1. The code on `CustomX509AuthenticationProcessingFilter#attemptAuthentication` looks strange, ideally it should run the authentication token against an `AuthenticationManager`, see the `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter` [implementation as an example](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/61e2bae7f2a3127c6b0ca662a2611ac8fff091f2/web/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/web/authentication/UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.java#L72-L85).
2. The token returned from `CustomX509AuthenticationProcessingFilter#attemptAuthentication` is not authenticated, therefore, when using `authorizeRequests(...)` and the code hits [this method](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/61e2bae7f2a3127c6b0ca662a2611ac8fff091f2/core/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/access/intercept/AbstractSecurityInterceptor.java#L321-L337), that unauthenticated token gets authenticated using the `CustomX509AuthenticationProvider`. However, when you switch to `authorizeHttpRequests` you are switching from `FilterSecurityInterceptor` to `AuthorizationFilter`, and the latter does not re-authenticate the request.

With that said I suggest that you put a breakpoint on the code I linked above to check the behavior described and you should revisit your custom filter implementation in order to validate the authentication token against the `AuthenticationManager` that you already have, that should get things working for you.",1,1,prediction_comments_springsecurity.csv

6341,"Damn, I'd have a longer sleep if I'd just wait for you to answer :D

I wrote `SecurityNamespaceHandlerTest` class and was trying to write some tests of `SecurityNamespaceHandler` from scratch. After about half on hours I found out that there already is a `SecurityNamespaceHandlerTest` class without missing 's'. After that I thought that the first thing should be writing a test to test well... a test. Which was to test if `InMemoryXmlApplicationContext#SPRING_SECURITY_VERSION` is set correctly:

	@Test
	public void InMemoryXmlWebApplicationContextRunsWithNewestXSDAsDefault() throws IOException {
		InMemoryXmlApplicationContext defaultContext = new InMemoryXmlApplicationContext("""");
		String computedXSDVersion = getSpringVersionFromSpringSchemas();
		InMemoryXmlApplicationContext versionedContext = new InMemoryXmlApplicationContext("""", computedXSDVersion,
				null);

		Resource defaultXML = Whitebox.getInternalState(defaultContext, ""inMemoryXml"");
		Resource versionedXML = Whitebox.getInternalState(versionedContext, ""inMemoryXml"");

		assertThat(defaultXML).isEqualTo(versionedXML)
				.withFailMessage(""InMemoryXmlApplicationContext is not using a current XSD schema as a default"");
	}

Than I was trying to find out how to test it without `WhiteBox` and without getting direct access to the `InMemoryXmlApplicationContext#SPRING_SECURITY_VERSION`. Then I thought it's really time to sleep, so I turn off my PC and... read the message from you on my phone :-)

I am trying to integrate Snapchat Login Kit with Spring Security OAuth2, and let me just say: it's a pain in the ass (Snapchat has the worst documentation I've ever read, maybe because it's still in development). Although not documented, the Login Kit requires the PKCE parameters (code_verifier, code_challenge, and code_challenge_method) passed. 

Now, I started writing a rather large oauth2 library myself to support this (I couldn't find any Java libraries that support PKCE), and then noticed that Spring Security already had an OAuth2 library-- and so far it works great and I love it.

14986,"If merged, @rwinch, this will create a SonarQube project for each Jenkins branch definition.

There are a couple reasons this is beneficial:

**First**, each time the project is built, it overrides whatever is in SonarQube at the time. When a build from one branch follows one from another branch, this screws up the timeline reports and makes the issue list hard to take action on.

For example, if I'm looking at the issues list, and an analysis is run for a different branch, then once that analysis finishes, the issues list has now changed. As branches get further apart, it becomes a larger problem.

Or, when looking at timelines, we get a sawtooth view since on one run, we have 48k lines of code, but on the next run, we have 54k lines, since they were actually for different branches. In addition to the graphs being harder to interpret, it makes SonarQube's leak report worthless.

**Second**, having all branches point to the same SonarQube project creates race conditions for background tasks. For example, if two builds are run very close together (call them A and B), then the following can happen:

Run A notes the timestamp of its analysis
Run B notes the timestamp of its analysis
Run B pushes a background task onto the queue
Run A pushes a background task onto the queue

Now, Run A must wait for Run B's background task to complete.

Once Run B has completed, the timestamp for the most recent analysis for the project is updated (to B's timestamp). And, when Run A's background task begins, it notes that its timestamp is older than the most recent and fails.

This is made more likely by running analyses on every build and could be fixed with a quiet period in Jenkins. However, Quiet Periods can only be applied per-branch.

If we have a one-to-one mapping, though, between a Jenkins branch definition and a SonarQube project, then first, there will be no cross-branch collision, and second, a Jenkins quiet period can effectively be applied to push SonarQube analyses apart, avoiding the race condition.

As an alternative, there may yet be some way to impose a quiet period across all the spring-security branches in Jenkins, though I have not yet found one. I don't prefer this solution since it doesn't address the first problem.",1,1,prediction_comments_springsecurity.csv

The ability to add  from the UI a T&C and Privacy terms users must accept and have access to will go a long way. Also a generic template built-in will be great.

5217,Nevermind. Found a solution.,1,1,prediction_comments_thingsboard.csv
5890,"@mcpicoli What if you try using 
```
if (key && key.indexOf(""polso_"") > -1) {
    // work
```

The substring method seems to be exculsive to strings, but the indexOf method might get around that. I think it would still not work correctly, but maybe it wont shut down your rule node?

Also, I've just now noticed what the issue probably is. In your for loop you have 
``` for (k = 0; k < keys.length; k++) {}```

This is thingsboard kryptonite. What you should have is
``` for (var k = 0; k < keys.length; k++) {}```

Or 
``` 
Object.keys(msg).forEach(function (key) {
    //work
}
```

The reason is that in your version, you are declaring k=0 at the start of the loop. This isn't a local declaration, you're setting the variable k=0 globally across your whole instance. That means if two messages reach this node at slightly different times and are looping through the process will be like this:

Loop A sets k=0  > does work
Loop A does it's work
Loop B sets k=0
Loop A finishes work and sets k=1
Loop B starts doing work, but instead of using k=0 it's using k=1, but that's not possible
So Loop B gets something like ``` var key = keys[1] // But keys doesn't have an index 1 > returns undefined```

To verify what I'm saying here, add in an empty Tansformation-script node and have the following, nothing else in the node
``` return {msg: {""test"":k}, metadata: metadata, msgType: msgType}```

Don't open the node with ""Test transformer function"" button, just write in the box and save it.

@Karabiy 
I can invoke rule node in rule chain form the widget ?? **Holy crap i wasn't aware of this.**
How do i do that - i've checked input widgets and they all use attributeService to update the values, i haven't seen any code related to launching or connecting to the rule engine.
Can you add some insights on how to launch the rule chain or external node from widget ?",1,1,prediction_comments_thingsboard.csv
7996,"@amizer12 Yes I did just this. I implemented a time-based ""filter"".
When a new attribute arrives, the device waits some seconds till it publishes its values. The idea is that all pending messages will have arrived by then, so only the latest value will be sent back.

Keep in mind that the delay must be somehow more than your MQTT timeout value.

Of course, it is not working too. **It is horrible**.
It somehow makes things better, that's way I have left this in. It mostly solves problems caused by #1810. And generally the system, if it gets to the point of oscillating, it will eventually stop.

But:
1. The problem is not solved. With the right timing you will have oscillations again. (caused if the second command arrives just by the time the filter has timed-out).
2. The device response is now very very slow. You have to wait for the filter to expire to get the new value in the dashboard.
3. Initialization of our system is a mess...
4. Network traffic can be seriously reduced.

8405,"I used to have the same use case.
RPC is an option but it sucks as it heavily relies on your devices being online all the time, what i endup using is creating a widget ( knob or whatever ) that will read and save the temperature data as device attribute, on atribute update the attribute service will send the updates via mqtt to node-red device that will process the change further, the same way the other way around - when i change something on node red device it is sending new attribute value to thingsboard.

Start with empty dashboard and client or shared attribute change widget ( it`s in the pre-installed bundle).
Configure widget to read the device attribute an dupdate on change and then on node-red configure mqtt connection to and from thingsboard.
Once you have this you will be able to modiy value from dashboard and you will see new values coming into node-red.
Once you have this working then it`s just a matter of creting some better widget on the dashboard so it`s more user friendly - pure front-end work",1,1,prediction_comments_thingsboard.csv
