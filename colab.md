## Google Colaboratory:
   1. We also provide a colab file "civilityModel.ipynb" under the folder "Colab Run", Where you can run all the finetuned models, 
      give sample inputs and see outputs. 
   2. All you need to upload the prepared detection and translation models prepared by us to the google drive and adjust the paths.
   3. Select GPU runtime in Colab, then run all.  
   4. To run it takes 3-4 mins. If succesffully run, at the end the program ask for user input. Please give your input, press enter 
      and see the suggestions if the input comment is detection as uncivil.
   5. If you want to run the colab file in very short time then login gmail with the following credentials. Then go the google drive and run the "civilityModel.ipynb" file. Again
      it takes 3-4 mins. If succesffully run, at the end the program ask for user input. Please give your input, press enter and see the suggestions if the input comment is detection as uncivil.
