"2 things:
 
 1) Is it possible to UNPAUSE a machine which is RUNNING!? (I would think that you can only UNPAUSE something that is PAUSED, hidden bug? Why UNPAUSING is being saved to the db if the current state is RUNNING?)
 
 2) I think that for [UN]PAUSING we should take a different approach than this.
 
 At this point, the real state of the instance is unknown right? We don't know whether the instance was paused or not, but, we already know the desired state and the current state why we just don't automate that?
 
 If before n-cpu crashed the user requested to pause that instance and I assume that the API have returned saying that the requested was accept, why we don't re-issue the [un]pause_instance() request here?
 
 I mean users would be like: ""fuck yeah automation""!
 
 Instead of just cleaning up the states, leaving the machine in an unknown state and having the user to reissue the request to [un]pause the machine again.
 
 (And sorry if someone already suggested that, I haven't looked in all previous patch-sets to see if that's the case)","Two points to consider:
Is it possible to unpause a machine that is currently running? I always thought you could only unpause something that is currently paused. Is there a hidden bug here? Also, why is the action of unpausing being saved to the database if the current state is already running?

I think we should explore a different approach for pausing and unpausing. Currently, the real state of the instance is unknown, right? We don't know whether the instance was paused or not, but we already have the desired state and the current state. Why don't we automate the process based on that information?

For example, if before the n-cpu crashed, the user requested to pause that instance and the API confirmed the request, shouldn't we re-issue the unpause_instance() request here? Users would probably appreciate the automation instead of having to manually reissue the request to unpause the machine, leaving it in an unknown state.

"Well the logic of claiming/consuming instances is not what caused this bug (and it is well tested). What caused it is moving to and from objects in the resource tracker, and then dropping an important field due to that.
 
 So in the resource tracker we have pci pool dicts (would contain numa_node as a key), but then we convert them to objects [1] by using PciDevicePool.from_dict, which would drop the field and save it as part of tags.
 
 Upon reading them in on the scheduler side, we call PciDevicePool.to_dict, which of course will not know about the 'numa_node' since it's not on the object. For filtering to work numa_node needs to match (and it's actually gone) so all requests fail.
 
 The code in [1] merged 2 months after the patch that introduces NUMA awareness of PCI devices.
 
 TL; DR - this got borken by our neverending objects fuckery - it was not broken by definition as you seem to imply with your comments here.
 
 The commit message is misleading though so I will update it now.
 
 [1] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/6b69b705481958bc55f9d4e29732b09a45f392a5/nova/scheduler/client/report.py#L64","The issue at hand was not caused by the logic of claiming/consuming instances (which has been thoroughly tested). The problem arose when transitioning between objects in the resource tracker and accidentally dropping an important field in the process.
In the resource tracker, we have PCI pool dictionaries (which include 'numa_node' as a key), but when converting them to objects [1] using PciDevicePool.from_dict, the 'numa_node' field gets omitted and saved as part of the tags.
When reading them in the scheduler, we call PciDevicePool.to_dict, which is unaware of the 'numa_node' field since it's not present in the object. Filtering requires 'numa_node' to match (which is now missing), resulting in all requests failing.
The code in [1] was merged two months after the patch that introduced NUMA awareness of PCI devices.

"> javascript: stupidest thing ever?

So interesting :D It seems you are asking if this can be treated as plain text. But I don't think GURL is smart enough to understand javascript syntax. Telling ""javacript: stupidest thing ever?"" from ""javascript: var a = 0; alert(a); "" would be really difficult. So is_valid() returns true for both I guess. (roughly tested but ""javascript: stu..."" wasn't droppable with is_valid())

> we shouldn't even try to check the Javascript scheme here,

This reminds me of our previous conversation. https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1013821/7/chrome/browser/ui/views/frame/browser_root_view.cc#180
Like !file_supported case, I think arrow on tabstrip and cursor icon should indicate that javascript scheme can't be dropped during drag session. So I think it's better to check the scheme here as long as we can.

> I also wonder if this shouldn't merge with omnibox drop handling so we just allow but auto-strip javascript: instead of banning it...

This seems to be worth trying. Let me give it a shot before long.","Interesting observation! It seems like you're asking if we can treat this as plain text.

The reminder about our previous conversation is here: [link to the previous conversation].

 This explains why if you take a row lock and then update that row, Galera will maintain the same ACID semantics albeit by a different mechanism: rollback instead of waiting. It doesn't need to propagate write intent locks to do this. The failure mode isn't relevant here, only that it has predictable behaviour.
 
 However, as you point out there *is* a semantic difference here because we hold a row lock while updating a different row.

Using !ERRORLEVEL! tells the interpreter not to expand anything until the statement is really executed.","This section requires the use of ""!ERRORLEVEL!"".
Based on my understanding, 'if ()' statements are treated as a single ""line"" with immediate variable substitution. Therefore, if %ERRORLEVEL% was 0 BEFORE entering the 'if' statement, it would remain 0 inside 'if', regardless of any subsequent calls.

Worse, if the init method goes and invokes methods to finish initialization, if an intermediate value is stashed on the instance, the method can use that value w/out you getting an AttributeError; etc, thus assign once stable.

"Ah, damn - good catch! You're making me rethink the way we are doing things here. Essentially, all we really want to do is make sure that what is in CryptAuth matches the current GcmDeviceInfo.

Now that I think about it more, we probably don't need to store anything in preferences at all. I think we could just do the following:

(1) Inspect the GcmDeviceInfo and the local device metadata. If they contain the same supported features, we are done.
(2) If they do not, then force enrollment/sync until they contain the same supported features.

In this scheme, we wouldn't need to worry about the ListValues at all, since we wouldn't be storing any values in preferences.

but now i guess you were actually talking about ones like _POSIX_SS_REPL_MAX which should _not_ be defined if you don't have the optional feature it belongs to. obviously these ones need to _not_ be defined.

as for _POSIX2_FORT_DEV, note the ""if"" in what POSIX actually says: ""If this symbol is defined in <unistd.h>, it shall be defined to be -1, 0, or 200809L."". the little ""[FD]"" next to the name means that this is part of the optional extra FD (Fortran Development). we don't have that, so we don't need to have any of the defines, and it's probably less confusing to just remove them.

"(It took me a month to understand what this code was supposed to do, so who is being stupid here?:).
First, I find out if the destination is 1 cell or a range, and if the source area is large than the selected destination area [1271-1279]. The largest area of these is taken for the comparisons [1282-1283], as this will be the actual destination area (copy/paste some blocks and you will see what I mean if my text is not clear).
The first comparison is whether source and destination area overlap [1284-1288]. When the source area contains references, these probably will go wrong when there is an overlap. As this may produce data loss (e.g. formulas that get wrong references), it _must_ be avoided. This code was there from the beginning, but with errors, disabling the wrong options. My first patch fixed only a part of that.
The second comparison [1294-1327] handles something else, the question whether shifting the cells in the destination area will fit on the sheet. This comparison is not necessary for integrity, but for user friendliness. Without the comparison, the user will get a message that the result will not fit and no harm is done. Rainer Bielefeld wanted the possibilty of fitting on the sheet reflected in the en/disabling of the shift options.
I do this check by going from the MAXCOL/MAXROW position back for the width/height of the destination area and checking if the cells are empty. If not, paste+shift will not fit and the appropiate shit option is disabled.
I feared a performance penalty with this method, but I tested it on an old. slow machine (complete build of Libreofiice takes 24hrs) with a destination area almost MAXROW high and that gave no noticeable delay.
But because of this performance penalty danger, i want you to have a good look at the code. Perhaps it will be safer to leave it out, perhaps there are more efficient ways to check the fitting.

I hope my proze give you the explanation you want.
Perhaps I should put some of it in the code as comment?","It took me a while to fully understand the purpose of this code, so perhaps the clarity could be improved.

Please note that the initial comparison checks for any overlap between the source and destination areas [1284-1288]. If the source area contains references, an overlap can lead to incorrect results, potentially causing data loss (e.g., formulas with incorrect references). Therefore, it's crucial to avoid such overlap. The code you see was present from the beginning but contained errors that disabled the wrong options. My previous patch resolved part of the issue. Additionally, the second comparison [1294-1327] addresses a different aspect: whether shifting the cells in the destination area will fit within the sheet. Although this comparison isn't necessary for maintaining data integrity, it contributes to user-friendliness. Without this check, the user would receive a message indicating that the result won't fit, but no actual harm would occur. Rainer Bielefeld requested the ability to enable or disable shift options based on whether they would fit on the sheet. To achieve this, I traverse the destination area backward, starting from the MAXCOL/MAXROW position and checking if the cells are empty. If they are not, it means that pasting and shifting won't fit, and the corresponding shift option should be disabled. While I had concerns about potential performance issues, I conducted tests on an old, slow machine (a complete build of LibreOffice takes 24 hours), using a destination area nearly as high as MAXROW, and no noticeable delay occurred. Nevertheless, due to the possible performance impact, I would appreciate a thorough review of the code. Perhaps there are more efficient ways to accomplish the desired check.",,

"Same reasoning given for GerritHelper.__init__ .

When doing default arguments/fallbacks like this, one needs to be *extremely* explicit in the check else you can get bit in the ass pretty easily.

Consider the following prototype:

def DoSomeStuff(myargs, cache_override=None):
  if not cache_override:
    cache_override = self._internal_cache
  self._ReallyDoStuff(myargs, cache_override)

It's subtle, but that block of code will incorrectly fallback to the internal cache if the passed in cache_override is {} (which may be entirely intentional- to force a run w/out using internal caches values).

If you use the 'is None', check, it handles it correctly.  The only ass biter in scenarios like that is when you need to detect if None was explicitly passed in, in which case you use an object() singleton to detect it.","Similar reasoning applies to GerritHelper.init.
When using default arguments or fallbacks like this, it's crucial to be extremely explicit in the check. Otherwise, it can lead to issues. Consider the following prototype as an example:

def DoSomeStuff(myargs, cache_override=None):
  if not cache_override:
    cache_override = self._internal_cache
  self._ReallyDoStuff(myargs, cache_override)
It's subtle, but in that code block, if the cache_override is set to any falsey value (e.g., an empty string, 0, or False), the fallback to self._internal_cache won't trigger, and the behavior might not be as intended. To avoid any confusion or unexpected behavior, it's recommended to use an explicit != 0 check or similar condition when handling fallbacks.

"Right, I tried by passing in ProcessMemory here instead since that has a base/derived structure, thinking that on Mac, Linux/Android, and Fuchsia we only used process_reader_->Memory() below and that that could be treated as a base ""ProcessMemory"". But:

 2) I didn't look at the body of MergeWithOtherSnapshotImpl() which is a friend and it uses process_reader_, and needs the real type, and;
 3) Fuchsia didn't actually have a Memory() method anyway (though that one is addable).
 
 I could probably share Fuchsia's with Linux's, but it'd still need to be a template then to handle ProcessReader, so it seemed less worthwhile since shoving it all in the header sort of sucks. (I also couldn't think of a name for the template... MemorySnapshotLinuxAndroidFuchsia isn't exactly pretty.)

 * How can I form a query that says ""only give me results after the upgrade""?

If the same tag can be associated with multiple resources and the same resource can have multiple tags, this approach may lead to duplicated entries and a non-normalized schema. It would be more efficient to have a separate tag table and a mapping table to handle associations. While this approach requires additional work, it leverages the capabilities of the database management system.",,
"I am a bit concerned about the implementation here.
 
 If you say that (the same) tag can be associated to multiple resources, and that (the same) resource is associated to multiple tags, this is not the right way to model this logically, otherwise you'll end up having lots of duplicated and a non-normalized schema.
 
 Say for instance that I want to tag my networks with 'golden'. I'd need to have lots of entries like so:
 
  1, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_1
  2, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_2
  3, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_3
  4, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_4
 
 This is a waste from a number of perspectives: from storage, lookup and cascading effects.
 
 Instead you should have, a tag table
 
  tag, description, where tag is key
 
 and a mapping table
 
  tag_id, resource_type, resource_id
 
 This still sucks though, because now you cannot enforce the foreign key constraint on resource id; i.e. if a resource gets deleted now you gotta enforce the delete on cascade via programming logic, which is yucky.
 
 Ultimately we'd need to have a mapping table for resource. I know, it's more work, but that gives you the most leverage of the DBMS capabilies","Oops, good catch! It appears I made a mistake due to my dyslexia. I apologize for the confusion caused.",,

 I agree that these names suck. But they are consistent with he API that's being used, so I think the code is more readable this way (i.e. calling it io_vector instead of iov wouldn't make this code easier to understand IMO, and I'm not even sure that ""iov"" means ""IO vector"" or something else).

"funny definition of ""shorter"". 
Getting the human readable version is done to be consistent with other checks that not only print ""bah, your installed version sucks"", but also being able to print ""we detected that you have version xy installed, but we need at least version wz""

Also your proposal fails short since not all versions of flex report the version as second field. Especially those that are not suitable to build (like 2.5.4 for example) print ""flex version <whatever version>"":
$ /usr/bin/flex -V | cut -d"" "" -f2 | sed 's/\.//'g
version

Also while your suggestion works for something like flex (where not much releases are expected), it doesn't account for increase/decrease of the digits in the minor/micro version part

while 2.5.36 will fulfill the test when shortened to 2536 and compared to 2535, a hypothetical version 2.6.1 will be treated as 261 and thus fail the check.

If you only want one single command, and disregard storing the version for printing in the error in case of failure to pass, then one could use 

flex --version |awk '{split($NF,ver,"".""); printf(""%d%03d%03d"", ver[1], ver[2], ver[3])}'

of to be ""shorter"" :-) : flex -V | awk ....

But That is less readable, and requires doubling of the brackets to satisfy autoconf quoting.","That's an interesting definition of ""shorter."" The purpose of obtaining the human-readable version is to maintain consistency with other checks. Not only do we print ""Your installed version is inadequate,"" but we can also provide more specific information such as ""We detected version xy, but we require at least version wz."" The proposal falls short because not all versions of flex report the version as the second field. Additionally, it doesn't account for changes in the minor/micro version digits.

"Sorry, but this is a hack to *try* to make multi-slot work and this isn't sufficient. There were good reasons to why the earlier non-working multi slot support was removed from dw_mmc.
Let me elaborate a bit for your understanding. The core uses a host lock to serialize operations and commands, as to confirm to the SD/SDIO/(e)MMC specs. The above changes gives no guarantees for this. To make that work, we would need a ""mmc bus lock"" to be managed by the core. However, inventing a ""mmc bus lock"" would lead to other problems related to I/O scheduling for upper layers - it simply breaks. For example, I/O requests for one card/slot can then starve I/O requests reaching another card/slot.","I regret to inform you that this approach, which is intended to make multi-slot functionality work, is insufficient.

"Please enlighten me: how do you think this could be exploited? When an application calls VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT from a video0 device, it will just enumerate a hardware functionality, with is constant for a given hardware piece. The way it works is that userspace do something like this in order to read an entire const table. Usually, it doesn't require any special privilege to call this ioctl, but, even if someone changes its permission to 0x400, a simple lsusb output is enough to know what hardware model is there. A lsmod or cat also tells that the tm6000 module was loaded, with is a very good hint that the tm6000 is there or was there in the past.

In the specific case of tm6000, all hardware supports exactly the same formats, as this is usually defined per-driver. So, a quick look at the driver is enough to know exactly what the ioctl would answer.  Also, the net is full of other resources that would allow anyone to get the supported formats for a piece of hardware.

"I  confirm that in case of x86_64, the bss size is increased by around 1 M with standard config. For sparc there seems to be a dedicated CONFIG_LOCKDEP_SMALL, which seems to downsize the lockdep implementation anyway.

As example, the original report doesn't say that the process which holds this is different to the process which holds the other locks. On the contrary, it tells the user that all the locks are being held by the same task, which seems to be wrong. You likely also infer about the order of consuming the locks based on the contents of the stack dump associated to each lock. Without doing some mental diffs between the backtraces, it's not possible to see the chronological order of consuming the locks.

These calling conventions are rather suboptimal.  First of all, none of actor callbacks will ever get called directly. There are only 4 callers.  3 of them (all in this) are of this form.

Thanks for the review. The problem we have here is there is a potential to control 3 different LED string but only 2 sinks.  So control bank A can control 2 LED strings and control bank b can control 1 LED string. These values represent device level control and configuration of the LED strings to a specific control bank. I racked my brain trying to figure out how to configure the control banks and associated LED strings. These values are for the device configuration itself and the reg below indicates which control bank the LED node is assigned to. Don't see how you could compute this.  There is no easy way to give indication to the driver which LED node belongs to which control bank.  The control-bank-cfg is a device level property and the reg under the child is a LED string level property denoting the Class node to control bank mapping. Furthermore there are 2 device configurations that can be configured to only use 1 bank for all 3 LED strings. This will be answered in your comments in the code. This I can fix it should be a value between 1 and 6.,"Thank you for the feedback. We encountered a challenge where we have three LED strings but only two sinks available for control. As a solution, control bank A can handle two LED strings, and control bank B can handle one LED string. These values represent the device-level control and configuration of the LED strings assigned to a specific control bank. It was difficult to determine how to configure the control banks and associate them with the LED strings. Unfortunately, there is no straightforward way to indicate which LED node belongs to which control bank. The control-bank-cfg property represents the device-level configuration, while the reg property under each child represents the LED string-level configuration, indicating the mapping from the Class node to the control bank. There are also cases where only one control bank is used for all three LED strings in two different device configurations. I can address this by ensuring that the value falls within the range of 1 to 6.",,
"It is better do add some complexity to the driver than to the user configurable settings like DT. Besides - you will only need to check if given led-source is already taken by another node.

"I don't call this non-intrusive. I'll beg to differ; this isn't anywhere near something to consider merging. Also 'happened' suggests a certain stage of completeness, this again doesn't qualify. There are known scalability problems with the existing cgroup muck; you just made things a ton worse. The existing cgroup overhead is significant, you also made that many times worse. The cgroup stuff needs cleanups and optimization, not this. That is the whole and only reason you did this; and it doesn't even begin to cover the requirements for it. Not to mention I detest cgroups; for their inherent complixity and the performance costs associated with them.  _If_ we're going to do something for L1TF then I feel it should not depend on cgroups. It is after all, perfectly possible to run a kvm thingy without cgroups. 
Note that in order to avoid PLE and paravirt spinlocks and paravirt tlb-invalidate you have to gang-schedule the _entire_ VM, not just SMT siblings. Now explain to me how you're going to gang-schedule a VM with a good number of vCPU threads (say spanning a number of nodes) and preserving the rest of CFS without it turning into a massive trainwreck? Such things (gang scheduling VMs) _are_ possible, but not within the confines of something like CFS, they are also fairly inefficient because, as you do note, you will have to explicitly schedule idle time for idle vCPUs. Things like the Tableau scheduler are what come to mind; but I'm not sure how to integrate that with a general purpose scheduling scheme. You pretty much have to dedicate a set of CPUs to just scheduling VMs with such a scheduler. And that would call for cpuset-v2 integration along with a new scheduling class. And then people will complain again that partitioning a system isn't dynamic enough and we need magic :/ (and this too would be tricky to virtualize itself). You gloss over a ton of details here; many of which are non trivial and marked broken in your patches. Unless you have solid suggestions on how to deal with all of them, this is a complete non-starter. The per-cpu IRQ/steal time accounting for example. The task timeline isn't the same on every CPU because of those. You now basically require steal time and IRQ load to match between CPUs. That places very strict requirements and effectively breaks virt invariance. That is, the scheduler now behaves significantly different inside a VM than it does outside of it -- without the guest being gang scheduled itself and having physical pinning to reflect the same topology the coschedule=1 thing should not be exposed in a guest. And that is a mayor failing IMO. Also; I think you're sharing a cfs_rq between CPUs. that is broken, the virtual runtime stuff needs nontrivial modifications for multiple CPUs. And if you do that, I've no idea how you're dealing with SMP affinities. You don't even begin to outline how you preserve smp-nice fairness. IOW it's completely friggin useless for L1TF. Have you actually read your own code? What about that atrocious locking you sprinkle all over the place? 'some additional lock contention' doesn't even begin to describe that horror show. Hint: we're not going to increase the lockdep subclasses, and most certainly not for scheduler locking. All in all, I'm not inclined to consider this approach, it complicates an already overly complicated thing (cpu-cgroups) and has a ton of unresolved issues while at the same time it doesn't (and cannot) meet the goal it was made for.","I have a different perspective on this. I don't think this change qualifies as non-intrusive or meets the requirements for addressing the known scalability problems with the existing cgroup functionality. It seems to make the situation worse and introduces unresolved issues. I have concerns about the complexity and performance costs associated with cgroups. If we're considering a solution for L1TF, I believe it should not depend on cgroups, as it's possible to run a KVM without them. Gang-scheduling a VM with multiple vCPU threads while preserving CFS and avoiding issues like PLE and paravirt spinlocks is challenging. There are additional details and broken aspects in your patches that need attention before considering this approach. The overall impact on the scheduler's behavior inside and outside a VM is a major concern. The locking implementation in the code is also problematic and needs improvement. Given these factors, I don't think this approach is suitable.",,
"Mm... there is certainly room for interpretation. :) For example, it is still possible to set affinities, to use nice, and to tune all the other existing CFS knobs. That is, if you have tuned the scheduler to your workload or your workload depends on some CFS feature to work efficiently (whether on purpose or not), then running with this patch set should not change the behavior of said workload. This patch set should ""just"" give the user the additional ability to coordinate scheduling decisions across multiple CPUs. At least, that's my goal.

If someone doesn't need it, they don't have to use it. Just like task groups. But maybe, people start experimenting with coordinated scheduling decisions -- after all, there is a ton of research on what one *could* do, if there was coscheduling. I did look over much of that research. What I didn't like about many of them, is that evaluation is based on a ""prototype"", that -- while making the point that coscheduling might be beneficial for that use case -- totally screws over the scheduler for any other use case. Like coscheduling based on deterministic, timed context switches across all CPUs. Bye bye interactivity. That is, what I call intrusive.
As mentioned before, existing scheduler features, like preemption, (should) still work as before with this variant of coscheduling, with the same look and feel. And who knows, maybe someone will come up with a use case that moves coscheduling out of its niche; like the auto-grouping feature promoted the use of task groups. 
I agree, that this isn't ready to be merged. Still, the current state is good to start a discussion about the involved mechanics. Are you referring to cgroups in general, or task groups (aka. the cpu controller) specifically?
With respect to scalability: many coscheduling use cases don't require synchronization across the whole system. With this patch set, only those parts that are actually coscheduled are involved in synchronization. So, conceptually, this scales to larger systems from that point of view.
If coscheduling of a larger fraction of the system is required, costs increase. So what? It's a trade-off. It may *still* be beneficial for a use case. If it is, it might get adopted. If not, that particular use case may be considered impractical unless someone comes up with a better implementation of coscheduling.
With respect to the need of cleanups and optimizations: I agree, that task groups are a bit messy. For example, here's my current wish list off the top of my head: 
a) lazy scheduler operations; for example: when dequeuing a task, don't bother walking up the task group hierarchy to dequeue all the SEs -- do it lazily when encountering an empty CFS RQ during picking when we hold the lock anyway.
b) ability to move CFS RQs between CPUs: someone changed the affinity of a cpuset? No problem, just attach the runqueue with all the tasks elsewhere. No need to touch each and every task.
c) light-weight task groups: don't allocate a runqueue for every CPU in the system, when it is known that tasks in the task group will only ever run on at most two CPUs, or so. (And while there is of course a use case for VMs in this, another class of use cases are auxiliary tasks, see eg, [1-5].)
Is this the level of optimizations, you're thinking about? Or do you want to throw away the whole nested CFS RQ experience in the code? It really isn't. But as your mind seems made up, I'm not going to bother to argue. Yes it is. But, for example, you won't have group-based fairness between multiple kvm thingies. Assuming, there is a cgroup-less solution that can prevent simultaneous execution of tasks on a core, when they're not supposed to. How would you tell the scheduler, which tasks these are? You probably don't -- for the same reason, why it is a bad idea to give an endless loop realtime priority. It's just a bad idea. As I said in the text you quoted: coscheduling comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Just because you find one example, where it is a bad idea, doesn't make it a bad thing in general. With gang scheduling as defined by Feitelson and Rudolph, you'd have to explicitly schedule idle time. With coscheduling as defined by Ousterhout, you don't. In this patch set, the scheduling of idle time is ""merely"" a quirk of the implementation. And even with this implementation, there's nothing stopping you from down-sizing the width of the coscheduled set to take out the idle vCPUs dynamically, cutting down on fragmentation. Hence my ""counter"" suggestion in the form of this patch set: Integrated into a general purpose scheduler, no need to partition off a part of the system, not tied to just VM use cases. Yes, I do. :) I wanted a summary, not a design document. Maybe I was a bit to eager in condensing the design to just a few paragraphs... Address them one by one. Probably do some of the optimizations you suggested to just get rid of some of them. It's work in progress. Though, at this stage I am also really interested in things that are broken, that I am not aware of yet. I'll have to read up some more code to make a qualified statement here. It is not shared per se. There's only one CPU (the leader) making the scheduling decision for that runqueue and if another CPU needs to modify the runqueue, it works like it does for CPU runqueues as well: the other CPU works with the leader's time. There are also no tasks in a runqueue when it is responsible for more than one CPU.

Assuming, that a runqueue is responsible for a core and there are runnable tasks within the task group on said core, then there will one SE enqueued in that runqueue, a so called SD-SE (scheduling domain SE, or synchronization domain SE). This SD-SE represents the per CPU runqueues of this core of this task group. (As opposed to a ""normal"" task group SE (TG-SE), which represents just one runqueue in a different task group.) Tasks are still only enqueued in the per CPU runqueues. Works as before (or will work as before): a coscheduled task group has its own set of per CPU runqueues that hold the tasks of this group (per CPU). The load balancer will work on this subset of runqueues as it does on the ""normal"" per CPU runqueues -- smp-nice fairness and all. Do you believe me now, that L1TF is not ""the whole and only reason"" I did this? :grinning:
Currently, there are more code paths than I like, that climb up the parent relation to the top. They need to go, if we want to coschedule larger parts of the system in a more efficient manner. Hence, parts of my wish list further up.
That said, it is not as bad as you make it sound for the following three reasons:
a) The amount of CPUs that compete for a lock is currently governed by the ""cosched_max_level"" command line argument, making it a conscious decision to increase the overall overhead. Hence, coscheduling at, e.g., core level does not have a too serious impact on lock contention.
b) The runqueue locks are usually only taken by the leader of said runqueue. Hence, there is often only one user per lock even at higher levels. The prominent exception at this stage of the patch set is that enqueue and dequeue operations walk up the hierarchy up to the ""cosched_max_level"". And even then, due to lock chaining, multiple enqueue/dequeue operations on different CPUs can bubble up the shared part of the hierarchy in parallel.
c) The scheduling decision does not cause any lock contention by itself. Each CPU only accesses runqueues, where itself is the leader. Hence, once you have a relatively stable situation, lock contention is not an issue.
That's fine. Due to the overhead of nesting cgroups that you mentioned earlier, that many levels in the runqueue hierarchy are likely to be impracticable anyway. For the future, I imagine a more dynamic variant of task groups/scheduling domains, that can provide all the flexibility one would want without that deep of a nesting. At this stage, it is just a way to experiment with larger systems without having to disable lockdep.
Of course, if you have a suggestion for a different locking scheme, we can discuss that as well. The current one, is what I considered most suitable among some alternatives under the premise I was working: integrate coscheduling in a scheduler as an additional feature (instead of, eg, write a scheduler capable of coscheduling). So, I probably haven't considered all alternatives. Even if you're not inclined -- at this stage, if I may be so bold :) -- your feedback is valuable. Thank you for that.","There are different interpretations possible in this context. This patch set aims to provide the user with the ability to coordinate scheduling decisions across multiple CPUs while still retaining existing scheduler features like affinities and nice values. It doesn't aim to change the behavior of workloads that have already been tuned for the scheduler or rely on specific CFS features. It's an additional capability that users can choose to utilize if needed. While it's not ready for merging yet, it can serve as a starting point for discussing the mechanics involved. I'm interested in feedback on whether we should focus on cgroups in general or specifically on task groups (cpu controller). There are optimizations and cleanups needed in the task group code, such as lazy scheduler operations, the ability to move runqueues between CPUs, and more lightweight task groups. Would you like to discuss these optimizations further, or do you have different suggestions in mind?",,

"It would be very helpful if you cc all involved people on the cover letter instead of just cc'ing your own pile of email addresses. CC'ed now. This is really not helpful. The cover letter and the change logs should contain a summary of that discussion and a proper justification of the proposed change. Just saying 'sysadmins might want to allow' is not useful at all, it's yet another 'I want a pony' thing.

I read through the previous thread and there was a clear request to involve security people into this. Especially those who are deeply involved with hardware side channels. I don't see anyone Cc'ed on the whole series. For the record, I'm not buying the handwavy 'more noise' argument at all. It wants a proper analysis and we need to come up with criteria which PMUs can be exposed at all.

Just throwing magic knobs at sysadmins and then saying 'its their problem to figure it out' is not acceptable.","It would be highly beneficial if you could include all relevant individuals in the cc list of the cover letter, rather than only including your own email addresses. I have now added the necessary cc recipients. In order to provide a comprehensive justification for the proposed change, it is important for the cover letter and change logs to contain a summary of the discussion. Simply stating ""sysadmins might want to allow"" is not sufficient. In reviewing the previous thread, it was evident that involving security personnel, particularly those with expertise in hardware side channels, was explicitly requested. I did not observe any cc'ed individuals throughout the entire series. I believe that the argument against including more cc recipients solely based on generating more noise is not convincing. Instead, we should conduct a thorough analysis and establish criteria for which PMUs can be exposed. It is essential to have proper documentation that clearly explains the risks and scope of these knobs per PMU. Merely introducing magic knobs to sysadmins and leaving them to figure out the implications is not acceptable.",,

Okay, for the next round I will expand the cover letter with at least one concrete example on how it is usable and summarize the discussion a bit. Who would you recommend I add? Because I really don't know..
Presumably you see adding fine grained control as diminishing the overall security rather than raising it? Could you explain why? Because incompetent sysadmin will turn it off for some PMU, while without having the fine-grained control they wouldn't turn it off globally? This feature was requested by the exact opposite concern, that in order to access the i915 PMU, one has to compromise the security of the entire system by allowing access to *all* PMU's. Making this ability fine-grained sounds like a logical solution for solving this weakening of security controls. Concrete example was that on video transcoding farms users want to monitor the utilization of GPU engines (like CPU cores) and they can do that via the i915 PMU. But for that to work today they have to dial down the global perf_event_paranoid setting. Obvious improvement was to allow them to only dial down the i915.perf_event_paranoid setting. As such, for this specific use case at least, the security is increased.","I acknowledge that it was an oversight on my part to omit adding cc recipients in the cover letter. However, the inclusion of my own email addresses should not be a concern for you. It simply reflects what is specified in my .gitconfig, and I unintentionally forgot to do so manually.

Could you please suggest individuals whom I should add? As I am not aware of the appropriate contacts, your recommendations would be valuable. Regarding the fine-grained control, it seems you perceive it as compromising overall security rather than enhancing it. I would appreciate an explanation of your viewpoint. Are you concerned that incompetent sysadmins may disable it for certain PMUs, whereas without fine-grained control, they would not disable it globally? However, the request for this feature arose from the opposite concern, as accessing the i915 PMU currently requires compromising the security of the entire system by enabling access to all PMUs. Offering fine-grained control seems like a logical solution to address this issue and strengthen security controls. A concrete example is video transcoding farms where users need to monitor the utilization of GPU engines (similar to CPU cores), and they can achieve this through the i915 PMU. However, under the current setup, they must lower the global perf_event_paranoid setting. The suggested improvement is to allow them to adjust only the i915.perf_event_paranoid setting. Hence, for this specific use case, security is enhanced.",,
"The keyword in the above sentence is 'just'. You can add as many of yours
as you want as long as everybody else is cc'ed. Sure, and because you don't know you didn't bother to ask around and ignored the review request. I already added Kees and Jann. Please look for the SECCOMP folks in MAINTAINERS. I did not say at all that this might be diminishing security. And the argumentation with 'incompetent sysadmins' is just the wrong attitude.
What I was asking for is proper documentation and this proper documentation is meant for _competent_ sysadmins.
That documentation has to clearly describe what kind of information is accessible and what potential side effects security wise this might have. You cannot expect that even competent sysadmins know offhand what which PMU might expose. And telling them 'Use Google' is just not the right thing to do.
If you can't explain and document it, then providing the knob is just fulfilling somebodys 'I want a pony' request.
Sure, and this wants to be documented in the cover letter and the changelogs.
But this does also require a proper analysis and documentation why it is not a security risk to expose the i915 PMU or what potential security issues this can create, so that the competent sysadmin can make a judgement.
And the same is required for all other PMUs which can be enabled in the same way for unprivileged access. And we might as well come to the conclusion via analysis that for some PMUs unpriviledged access is just not a good idea and exclude them. I surely know a few which qualify for exclusion, so the right approach is to provide this knob only when the risk is analyzed and documented and the PMU has been flagged as candidate for unpriviledged exposure. I.e. opt in and not opt out.","The keyword in your previous sentence is 'just.' You can add as many of your email addresses as you want, as long as everyone else is also cc'ed.

Wrong attitude what? I was trying to guess your reasoning (cues in ""presumably"" and a lot of question marks) since it wasn't clear to me why is your position what it is. I did not mention Google. Well it's not a pony, it is mechanism to avoid having to turn off all security. We can hopefully discuss it without ponies. I am happy to work on the mechanics of achieving this once the security guys and all PMU owners get involved. Even though I am not convinced the bar to allow fine-grained control should be evaluating all possible PMUs*, but if the security folks agree that is the case it is fine by me.
The part of my reply you did not quote explains how the fine-grained control improves security in existing deployments. The documentation I added refers to the existing perf_event_paranoid documentation for explanation of security concerns involved. Which is not much in itself. But essentially we both have a PMU and a knob already. I don't see why adding the same knob per-PMU needs much more stringent criteria to be accepted. But as said, that's for security people to decide.","I apologize if my previous interpretation of your statement was incorrect. I may have misunderstood your intention.

"Guessing my reasonings has nothing to do with you mentioning incompentent sysadmins. I did not say that you mentioned google.

If you want to make a pettifogger contest out of this discussion, then we can stop right here. I explained it technically why just adding a knob without further explanation and analysis is not acceptable. Making the knob opt in per PMU does not need all PMU owners to be involved. It allows to add the opt in flag on a case by case basis. The fact, that the existing knob is poorly documented does make an excuse for adding more knobs without documentation. Quite the contrary, if we notice that the existing knob lacks proper documentation, then we should fix that first.","Attempting to deduce your reasoning was not related to mentioning incompetent sysadmins. I did not claim that you explicitly mentioned Google. However, in the absence of documentation, sysadmins often resort to using search engines for information.

I provided a technical explanation for why introducing a knob without proper documentation and analysis is not acceptable. The proposal of making the knob opt-in per PMU does not necessitate involving all PMU owners. It allows for a case-by-case approach to implementing the opt-in flag.

"Ah only if google could simply answer all our questions! It's not like there is or isn't a security risk and that you can say that it is or it isn't in a global way.
Essentially these are channels of information. The channels always exist in form of timing variances for any shared resource (like shared caches or shared memory/IO/interconnect bandwidth) that can be measured. Perfmon counters make the channels generally less noisy, but they do not cause
them. To really close them completely you would need to avoid sharing anything, or not allowing to measure time, neither of which is practical short of an air gap. There are reasonable assesments you can make either way and the answers will be different based on your requirements. There isn't a single answer that works for everyone. 
There are cases where it isn't a problem at all. If you don't have multiple users on the system your tolerance should be extremely high. For users who have multiple users there can be different tradeoffs. So there isn't a single answer, and that is why it is important that this if configurable. ","It would be helpful to have comprehensive documentation as there is no definitive answer to the security risk posed by different configurations. The existence of channels for information sharing, such as shared resources with timing variances, is inherent in systems. While Perfmon counters reduce noise in these channels, they do not eliminate them entirely. It is impractical to completely close these channels without prohibiting resource sharing or time measurement. The appropriateness of different configurations depends on specific requirements, and a one-size-fits-all solution does not exist. Therefore, configurability is crucial to accommodate varying needs.",,

"The major feature close to USB is this one and it can be found in others protocols (standardization process).

Sorry, with the proliferation of sensors I cannot see a multi master sensor network based on USB. Yes, we already talked about secondary master support. I would bet to do something like in i2c, we don't need the same level of complexity found in USB. I agree with the controller folder but not with prefix. Please check what is already in the kernel.

"I think you didn't read my reply carefully. I'm not saying I3C == USB, I'm just saying that the way you interact with an I3C from a SW PoV is not at all the same as you would do for an I2C device. Do you deny that? Looks like there's a misunderstanding here. The question is not whether I3C will replace I2C or USB, of course it's meant to overcome the limitations of I2C. I'm just pointing out that, if we have to expose I3C devices, we should look at what other discoverable buses do (PCI, USB, ...), not what I2C does. 
There's a difference between a secondary master that waits for its time to become the currrent master, and a secondary master that provides I3C device features when it's acting as a slave (sensor, GPIO controller, ...). So far we focused on supporting the former. If there's a need for the latter, then we should start thinking about the slave framework...
Can you detail a bit more what you have in mind? I don't think we can do like I2C, simply because we need to expose a valid DCR  manuf-ID/PID so that other masters can bind the device to the appropriate driver on their side. Plus, if we're about to expose generic profiles, we likely don't want each I3C slave controller driver to do that on its own.
If we mix everything in the same subdir, I'd like to have an easy way to quickly identify those that are slave controllers and those that are master controllers. For the dual-role thing, maybe we can consider them as master (ones with advances slave features).
Would you be okay with drivers/i3c/controllers/{designware,dw}/..., so that you can have all designware drivers (for both slave and master blocks) in the same dir? For those that are placed directly under drivers/i3c/controllers/... (because they only have one .c file), I'd like to keep a standard prefix. And again, I'm questioning the necessity of per-IP directories at the root level. I'm not against per-IP directories, as long as they are classified like other HW blocks. No it's not vain, it's how we do discuss things in the community. I'm not saying I'm always right, but I need to understand the problems you're trying to solve to take a decision, and I don't think you initially gave all the details I needed to understand your PoV.

All I've seen so far are complaints on tiny details, it definitely doesn't prevent you from adding new features.","It seems there may have been a misunderstanding in my previous reply. I did not mean to imply that I3C is equivalent to USB or that it will replace I2C or USB. My point was that the way we interact with I3C devices from a software point of view is fundamentally different from how we interact with I2C devices. I believe it is important to consider other discoverable buses such as PCI and USB when exposing I3C devices, rather than solely relying on the approach used for I2C. There is a distinction between a secondary master that waits for its turn to become the current master and a secondary master that provides I3C device features when acting as a slave, such as sensors or GPIO controllers. So far, our focus has been on supporting the former. If there is a need for the latter, we should start considering a framework for slave functionality. Could you provide more details about your thoughts on this matter? I don't think we can follow the exact approach used for I2C since we need to expose a valid DCR manuf-ID/PID to allow other masters to bind the device to the appropriate driver on their side. Additionally, if we are planning to expose generic profiles, it would not be practical for each I3C slave controller driver to handle that individually. If we choose to mix everything in the same subdirectory, it would be beneficial to have a clear distinction between slave controllers and master controllers for easy identification. Regarding the directory structure, would you be open to having drivers/i3c/controllers/{designware,dw}/... so that all DesignWare drivers, both slave and master blocks, reside in the same directory? For drivers placed directly under drivers/i3c/controllers/... (those with only one .c file), it would be preferable to maintain a standard prefix.

I hope this clarifies my perspective, and I apologize for any confusion caused.",,
"If you want. Actually that's the most interesting part for me: discussing how we want to support I3C slave controllers or mixed master/slave controllers. All the driver split we're talking about here is just bikeshedding. Ok. I don't see why. If the driver is simple enough to fit in one file, there's no reason to create a new subdir. You think your DW IP is so complex and configurable that it requires several source files, fine, but please don't force others to do the same. Yes. You mean, inside a sub-folder? It depends what you do with those source files. If they are to be exposed directly as modules, then they should be prefixed. On the other hand, if you create a single module out of several source files, source files don't need to be prefixed, as long as the resulting module as a proper prefix.
I'm not saying the discussion is useless, just that it's happening way too early compared to the other things we should work on. If you were adding support for slaves, and were doing this split as part of this patch series explaining that part of the code between slave and master can be shared, then we wouldn't have this debate. But right now, you're telling me that we need to split the DW driver to prepare for features that have not even been discussed/proposed. That's what I'm complaining about.","If you wish, we can focus on discussing how we can support I3C slave controllers or mixed master/slave controllers, which is the most interesting aspect for me. The driver splitting we are currently discussing seems to be a matter of bikeshedding. If a driver is simple enough to fit in one file, there is no need to create a new subdirectory. While the complexity and configurability of the DW IP may require multiple source files, it should not be a requirement for all drivers. If the source files are intended to be exposed directly as modules, then they should be prefixed accordingly. However, if the files are combined into a single module, the source files themselves do not need to be prefixed as long as the resulting module has a proper prefix. I believe it is essential to prioritize our efforts and focus on other tasks before diving into this driver split, especially considering that it is being proposed in preparation for features that have not yet been discussed or proposed. My concern is that we are allocating unnecessary time and resources to a topic that may not be immediately relevant. I hope you understand my perspective on this matter.",,

"I agree that this statement is incorrect.

Calling this a lie is a completly unjustified personal attack on those who
spent quite a lot of time on writing up documentation in the first
place. It's suggesting that this document was written with malicious intent
and the purpose of deceiving someone. Care to explain why you are assuming
this to be the case?


Sure. That still does not justify the ""changelog"" you provided.


It's interesting that quite some people were actually happy about that
document. Sorry, that we weren't able to live up to your high standards.


What is the advertisement part again?


It's a document targeted at system administrators and it definitely should
not be burried somewhere in Documentation/x86. As there are more documents
being worked on for the other issues, I have a patch ready which moves that
stuff into a separate hardware vulnerabilites folder in the admin-guide.

FWIW, to the best of my knowledge the documentation about writing
changelogs is neither incorrect nor is it optional to adhere to it.


The 'Affected processors' section right below this is very clear about this being an Intel only issue (for now). So what exactly is the point of this change?
On x86-32? That's incorrect, because there are a lot of x86-32 systems which are not affected. Also it has nothing to do with the bit-width of the hardware. A 32bit kernel booted on a 64bit capable CPU has the same issue. For further correctness, this needs to mention that !PAE enabled kernels cannot do PTE inversion at all. The 2G limitation is not a general limitation. The limitation depends on the number of physical address bits supported by the cache (not the number of physical addresss bits exposed as pins) and is definitely not hardcoded to 2G. Just because your machine emits the 2G number does not make it universally correct. On a system with 36bit physical address space the limit is 32G and on some CPUs that's actually wrong as well, see: override_cache_bits. Quoting yourself, Where is the explanation for the 'really big 64bit systems' issue for correctness sake?","I respectfully disagree with the statement, as I believe it is incorrect. However, I want to emphasize that labeling it as a lie is unwarranted and unfair to the individuals who dedicated considerable time and effort to produce the documentation. It is not appropriate to assume malicious intent or deception. Can you please explain your perspective on this matter?

Regarding your second set of comments:

Could you please explain the purpose of this change considering the 'Affected processors' section clearly indicates that it currently applies only to Intel processors? I want to clarify if there is a specific reason for this modification.

I'd like to point out that the statement about x86-32 is incorrect. There are numerous x86-32 systems that are not affected by this issue. Furthermore, it is important to note that the problem is not dependent on the hardware's bit-width. Even when running a 32-bit kernel on a 64-bit capable CPU, the same issue persists. For the sake of accuracy, it should be mentioned that non-PAE enabled kernels cannot perform PTE inversion at all. The limitation of 2GB is not universally applicable; it depends on the number of physical address bits supported by the cache, not the number of exposed physical address bits. It is also worth noting that the value of 2GB is not hardcoded and can vary. For instance, on systems with a 36-bit physical address space, the limit is 32GB. Additionally, there are cases where this information is incorrect due to override_cache_bits. It would be helpful to address the issue of 'really big 64-bit systems' for the sake of completeness and accuracy.",,
"So how should it be called? I initally used less strong words, only to get ""Care to tell what's a lie instead of making bold statements?"" back. Also look at the timing of the thread. Ok, now can we have that document updated to meet the standards? Making it very clear from the begining this is x86-only issue. Yes, you can kind-of figure it out from the next section... except for Intel StrongArm. Next sentence speaks about ""present bit"" of ""page table entry"". That may be confusing for people familiar with other architectures, which may not have such bit. We should mention this is x86 before using x86-specific terminology. Ok. I don't know the detailed limits for each system; what about this?","Could we please update the document to make it clear from the beginning that this issue is specific to x86?

tell you that? Here is what you said. Nice try. What is 'the standards'? Your's or is there a general agreement?

Care to check how pte_present() is implemented across the architectures? Most of them use the PRESENT bit naming convention, just a few use VALID. That's truly confusing and truly x86 specific. It's not about detailed limits for particular systems. It's about the way the limit is determined on certain class of systems. And that can be deduced from the code. If you want to provide more accurate documentation then you better come up with something which is helpful instead of completely useless blurb like the below. How is the admin going to figure that out? What kind of systems might be affected by this? No. The mitigation is available when the kernel provides it.

"Thats a misleading statement.  We've never supported running newer applications on older kernels, and no one is forcing anyone to use the lksctp-tools library, I was only suggesting that, if we were to support this compatibility, that might be a place to offer it. Its also worth noting that we have precident for this.  If you look at the git log, this particular structure has been extended about 6 times in the life of sctp.
Also misleading, as it assumes that we're not intentionally doing this.  I get wanting to support running applications built for newer kernels on older kernels, but thats just not something that we do, and to say thats broken is misleading.  Older applications are required to run on newer kernels, but not vice versa, which is what you are asking for. 
And yes, this patch can be backported to older stable kernels, but by that same token, so can the patches that extend the struct, which would also fix the problem, while supporting the newer features, which seems to me to be the better solution for applications which are looking for that support.","I understand your concerns, but let's avoid making misleading statements. It's important to clarify that we don't officially support running newer applications on older kernels, and using the lksctp-tools library is not mandatory.

However, we can backport this patch, along with the patches that extend the struct, to fix the problem and provide support for newer features.",,
"I disagree with this, at least as a unilateral statement.  I would assert that an old program, within the constraints of the issue being discussed here, will run perfectly well, when built and run against a new kernel.
At issue is the size of the structure sctp_event_subscribe, and the fact that in several instances over the last few years, its been extended to be larger and encompass more events to subscribe to. Nominally an application will use this structure (roughly) as follows. Assume this code will be built and run against kernel versions A and B, in which:
A) has a struct with a size of 9 bytes
B) has a struct with a size of 10 bytes (due to the added
field)
That gives us 4 cases to handle
1) Application build against kernel A and run on kernel A.  This works fine, the sizes of the struct in question will always match
2) Application is built against kernel A and run on kernel B.  In this case, everything will work because the application passes a buffer of size 9, and the kernel accepts it, because it allows for buffers to be shorter than the current struct sctp_event_subscribe size. The kernel simply operates on the options available in the buffer.  The application is none the wiser, because it has no knoweldge of the new option, nor should it because it was built against kernel A, that never offered that option
3) Application is built against kernel B and run on kernel B.  This works fine for the same reason as (1).
4) Application is built against kernel B and run on kernel A.  This will break because the application is passing a buffer that is larger than what the kernel expects, and rightly so.   The application is passing in a buffer that is incompatible with what the running kernel expects.

We could look into ways in which to detect the cases in which this might be 'ok', but I don't see why we should bother, because at some point its still an error to pass in an incompatible buffer.  In my mind this is no different than trying to run a program that allocates hugepages on a kernel that doesn't support hugepages (just to make up an example).  Applications built against newer kernel can't expect all the features/semantics/etc to be identical to older kernels.

It shouldn't.  Assuming you have a program built against headers from kernel B (above), if you set a field in the structure that only exists in kernel B, and try to run it on kernel A, you will get an EINVAL return, which is correct behavior because you are attempting to deliver information to the kernel that kernel A (the running kernel) doesn't know about.  Thats correct behavior. I won't disagree about the niceness of versioning, but that ship has sailed.To be clear,  this is situation (1) above, and yeah, running on the kernel you built your application against should always work from a compatibility standpoint. Yes, but this is alawys the case for structures that change.  If you have an application built against kernel (B), and uses structure fields that only exist in that version of the kernel (and not earlier) will fail to compile when built against kernel (A) headers, and thats expected.  This happens with any kernel api that exists in a newer kernel but not an older kernel. Any time you make a system call to the kernel, you have to be prepared to handle the resulting error condition, thats not unexpected.  To assume that a system call will always work is bad programming practice.","I respectfully disagree with the statement that an old program will run perfectly well when built and run against a new kernel. The size of the structure sctp_event_subscribe has changed over time, and building against different kernel versions may result in compatibility issues. While there are scenarios where it can work, it's crucial to handle cases where the buffer passed by the application is incompatible with the running kernel. Compatibility cannot be assumed for all features and semantics between different kernel versions.",,
"What a complete mess we have here. Use new socket option numbers next time, do not change the size and/or layout of existing socket options. This whole thread, if you read it, is basically ""if we compatability this way, that breaks, and if we do compatability this other way oh shit this other thing doesn't work."" I think we really need to specifically check for the difference sizes that existed one by one, clear out the part not given by the user, and backport this as far back as possible in a way that in the older kernels we see if the user is actually trying to use the new features and if so error out. Which, btw, is terrible behavior.  Newly compiled apps should work on older kernels if they don't try to use the new features, and if they can the ones that want to try to use the new features should be able to fall back when that feature isn't available in a non-ambiguous and precisely defined way. The fact that the use of the new feature is hidden in the new structure elements is really rotten. This patch, at best, needs some work and definitely a longer and more detailed commit message.","This situation seems quite messy. In the future, let's use new socket option numbers instead of modifying the size and layout of existing options. To address the current issues, I suggest thoroughly examining each size difference that existed before, removing the parts not specified by the user, and backporting the changes as far back as possible. In older kernels, we should check if the user is attempting to use the new features and return an error if necessary. It would be helpful to clearly define a non-ambiguous fallback mechanism for applications that want to use new features but encounter their unavailability. Furthermore, this patch requires further improvements and a more detailed commit message.",,
